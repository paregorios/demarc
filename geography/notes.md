# Geography processing notes 2020


- some specific steps will be different for you, but key takeaways:
  - get comfortable with using different data formats for different stages of the process
    - why? because you want to use different tools or look at data in different ways
- get a list of toponyms and dump to CSV
  - used xslt to pull them out of word xml
  - cleaned strings and got unique list
    - look at all the spelling errors! Elaine Matthews about migration and data cleaning; maybe compare with Reynolds
  - why CSV? because geocollider
  - made two lists: ancient and modern because different lookups probably
  - used xslt: diss2toponyms.xsl
