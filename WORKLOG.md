Work Log
========

This is a work log for keeping rough track of how much time I've spend on the demarc project and when.

* 2012-05-23: 3 hours: Mostly on planes to produce diss2inst.xsl. [Dimitre Novatchev's how-to on the Kayessian method of node-set intersection in XPath](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3428104/selecting-siblings-between-two-nodes-using-xpath) was exactly what I needed to grab all the nodes between two milestone elements so that I could separately treat each instance in its own container.

* 2012-05-22: 3 hours: I already had the ODT and PDF files. Creating the repository at github, committing them, creating and committing the README, TODO, LICENSE, and this file; trying and inspecting the HTML export via LibreOffice from elliottDiss.odt; opening elliottDiss.odt in Oxygen and exporting contents.xml as elliottDiss.xml and inspecting same with regard to cross references.
