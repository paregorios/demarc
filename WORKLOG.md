Work Log
========

This is a work log for keeping rough track of how much time I've spend on the demarc project and when.

* 2012-05-22: 3 hours: I already had the ODT and PDF files. Creating the repository at github, committing them, creating and committing the README, TODO, LICENSE, and this file; trying and inspecting the HTML export via LibreOffice from elliottDiss.odt; opening elliottDiss.odt in Oxygen and exporting contents.xml as elliottDiss.xml and inspecting same with regard to cross references.
