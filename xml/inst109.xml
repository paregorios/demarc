      <seg type="instance-description">A single boundary marker attests to an <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi>between <placeName type="ancient">Vienne</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Vienne</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">France</placeName>) and the <placeName type="ancient">Ceutrones</placeName> or <placeName type="ancient">Ceutronae,</placeName> inhabitants of <placeName type="ancient">Axima</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Aime</placeName>).</seg>
   </p>
   <p>The individual who carried out the demarcation, on the emperor’s authority, had in his own right no direct legal authority over the two cities whose territory was demarcated. As Aichinger points out, <persName>Cn. Pinarius Cornelius Clemens</persName> was commander of the army of <placeName type="ancient">Germania Superior</placeName>, whereas <placeName type="ancient">Vienna</placeName> was located in <placeName type="ancient">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Axima </placeName>in <placeName type="ancient">Alpes Graiae et Poeninae</placeName>. The boundary between the two civic territories therefore was coincident with the provincial boundary. As a result, neither governor had the appropriate legal authority to adjust the boundary. That capacity fell to the emperor, and to anyone he might explicitly delegate for the purpose.<note n="460" xml:id="ftn460"> Aichinger 1982, 194-195.1. </note>
   </p>
   <p>Aichinger goes on to assume that this demarcation must have derived from a boundary dispute, accompanied with some degree of unrest in the area, thus necessitating the appointment of an imperial delegate who could bring to bear sufficient military force to quiet the unrest and enforce the settlement. This is a great deal to read into a relatively terse inscription. This text includes none of the judicial terminology that we have established as criteria for identifying boundary disputes. It merely says that <persName>Clemens</persName> established the boundary on the authority of the emperor. The reasons for the demarcation and the choice of person, as well as the mechanism whereby the emperor’s authority was delegated, are not spelled out in any degree. There is no mention of unrest or enforcement. On the other hand, the fact that it is not a governor who conducts the demarcation is of significant interest, and reinforces Aichinger’s thesis concerning the necessity of direct imperial involvement with territorial boundaries, “<seg type="treForeign">die den </seg>
