      <seg type="instance-description">A <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="la">de controversia finium</foreign>) between long-established Roman colonists and an indigenous community on the island of <placeName type="ancient">Corsica</placeName>, attested by a rescript of the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName>.</seg>
   </p>
   <p>In his rescript to the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini </placeName>– an indigenous community whose territory spanned the base of the <placeName type="modern">Cap Corse </placeName>peninsula on <placeName type="modern">Corsica</placeName> – <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> delegates resolution of their boundary dispute with long-established Roman colonists at <placeName type="ancient">Mariana </placeName>to the provincial governor. He explicitly indicates that a surveyor has been provided to support the governor’s investigation. The rescript also acknowledges the praise conferred upon a former governor of the island by the delegates of the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini</placeName>and, in addition, confirms the unspecified <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia</foreign> that had been conferred on the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini</placeName> by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName> and retained by the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini</placeName> through the reign of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Galba</persName>.</p>

      </ref> in which a provincial governor confirms that he has permitted an embassy of thanksgiving for a previous governor to be conveyed onward, presumably to <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName>.<note n="277" xml:id="ftn277"> This was part of <placeName type="ancient">Histria’s </placeName>long-abiding effort to gain regular confirmation of its ancestral rights to revenue from the preservation of fish harvested in the <placeName type="modern">Danube</placeName> delta, originally “granted by the emperor.” </note> There is no obvious reason why the provincial governor of <placeName type="ancient">Corsica</placeName> could not have handled a boundary dispute between two communities in his own province; nothing about the present case seems to require the emperor’s involvement. It would seem, again on the model of the Histrian documents, that he could even have confirmed the imperial <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia</foreign>. We can speculate that it was anxious concern on the part of the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini</placeName> themselves that led them to ask the governor for permission to convey praise of a former governor to the emperor in <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName>. This embassy gave them the opportunity to bundle together their other major concerns: the boundary dispute and the <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia</foreign>(the latter a particularly great concern given the chaos that had preceded <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian’s</persName> rise to power). <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName>acknowledges the praise of the former governor, confirms the validity of the <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficium</foreign> and returns the boundary dispute to the governor, who is in the best position to resolve it. </p>
   <p type="P41">The emperor Caesar <persName type="emperor">Vespasian</persName> Augustus sends greetings to the magistrates and senators of the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini</placeName>. I am glad that <persName>Otacilius Sagitta</persName>, my friend and procurator, governed you in such a way that he deserves your praise. As regards the boundary dispute that you have with the <placeName type="ancient">Mariani</placeName> relating to those fields that you bought from my procurator <persName>Publilius Memorialis</persName>: in order that <persName>Claudius Clemens</persName>, my procurator, might establish the boundary, I have written to him and I have sent a surveyor. I confirm the <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia</foreign>, given to you by the god <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName> after his seventh consulate, which <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia</foreign>you retained to the time of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Galba</persName>.</p>
