<p type="treDisputeStatement">These boundary markers carry texts recording <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi>s, but cannot be certainly categorized as disputes.</p>
<p rend="indent">Between the years AD 105 and AD 116/117, the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii </placeName>are on record as involved in at least seven different boundary demarcations in <placeName type="modern">North Africa</placeName>.<note n="474"> The discovery of yet another boundary marker was evidently announced at the 15th international conference <foreign rend="italic">L’Africa Romana</foreign>, held in Tozeur, 11-15 December 2002. One hopes it will appear in the conference volume: N. Kallala, “Une nouvelle borne de délimitation du territoire des Musulames.” Other papers were also scheduled that may bear on the topic of this dissertation, e.g., A. M’charek, “Aspects de la colonisation flavienne dans le territoire musulame,” P. López-Felpeto, “Organización territorial romana en communidades indígenas: algunos ejemplos africanos,” and G. Di Stefano, “Dai <placeName type="ancient">Nibgenii</placeName> a <placeName type="ancient">Turris Tamalleni</placeName>: Storie di confine lungo il <placeName type="ancient">limes Tripolitanus</placeName>” (<seg type="term">non vidi</seg>, pre-conference program, cf. http://www.uniss.it/africaromana/testi/programma_2002.htm). </note> The first four of these were carried out in AD 105 by the legate commanding <placeName type="ancient">legio III Augusta</placeName>, <persName>L. Minicius Natalis</persName>. At that time, he separated the territory of the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii</placeName> from an imperial estate (Texts <ref target="ddoc:5"><bibl><biblScope>89.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="ddoc:484"><bibl><biblScope>89.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), an estate belonging to an otherwise unattested owner named <persName>Valeria Atticilla</persName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:9"><bibl><biblScope>89.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), the territory of an otherwise unattested people called the <placeName type="ancient">*Tisibenenses</placeName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:11"><bibl><biblScope>89.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), and the territory of the Roman colony at <placeName type="ancient">Madauros</placeName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:7"><bibl><biblScope>89.5</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). All of the markers are inscribed with similar texts, invoking the emperor’s authority and recording <persName>Natalis’</persName>involvement as well as the names of the parties whose property or territory was demarcated.<note n="475"> A fragmentary boundary inscription found at <placeName type="ancient">Madauros</placeName> also bears the name of <persName>Natalis</persName> and seems to employ the same verbal formula, but it is not clear who owned or controlled the land from which that of the <placeName type="ancient">Madaurenses</placeName> was separated (Instance <ref target="#INST26"><bibl><biblScope>90</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). </note> Whether these demarcations, each attested by a separate bilateral boundary inscription, derived from the same administrative act or legal case is unclear.</p>
<p rend="indent">Eleven years later, a new legate in command of the legion, <persName>L. Acilius Strabo Clodius Nummus,</persName> demarcated the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii’s</placeName> boundaries again with the same imperial estate (Text <ref target="ddoc:6"><bibl><biblScope>89.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), with the territory of <placeName type="ancient">Madauros</placeName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:8"><bibl><biblScope>89.7</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), with another people called the <placeName type="ancient">Bul[la]menses</placeName>, and (on a three-party boundary marker) with both the imperial estate and the territory of the Roman colony at <placeName type="ancient">Ammaedara</placeName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:72"><bibl><biblScope>89.8</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). </p>
<p rend="indent">Often cited in this context, a fragmentary inscription, datable to AD 102, may allude to the abolition of the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii’s </placeName>traditional boundaries, or to the exile of an individual or a group beyond those boundaries (Text <ref target="ddoc:13"><bibl><biblScope>89.10</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). A poorly-preserved rupestral inscription may have mentioned the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii</placeName> and may have functioned as a boundary marker, but it is too badly damaged to be of any definitive value (Text <ref target="ddoc:345"><bibl><biblScope>89.11</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).</p>
<p rend="indent">For years, scholars argued that markers such as these should be seen as evidence of a progressive Roman effort aimed at the ‘cantonnement’ of the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii</placeName> (and other transhumant or semi-nomadic native peoples), concurrent with the extension of Roman military and colonial presence into the area at this period.<note n="476"> E.g., Bénabou 1976, 438. This confinement to an imposed territory is seen as both practical and punitive, an ongoing response to the support provided to <persName>Tacfarinas</persName> by the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii</placeName> in his revolt under <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName>(Hitchner 1994, 32-33, cf., Instance <ref target="#INST8"><bibl><biblScope>87</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). See further: Bénabou 1986, Benzinah ben Abdallah 1992 and Quinn 2003. </note> The ostensible goal: to convert uncooperative nomads into sedentary farmers by forcing them onto reservations. Since the 1970s, objections have been raised against this model. Archaeological survey and comparative methodologies have demonstrated that the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii</placeName> were not so much a large tribe as “an amorphous alliance group which covered a region of great ecological variety ... that certainly included some agriculture before the Romans arrived.”<note n="477"> Whittaker 1978, 345. </note> These problems are acknowledged by E. Fentress in her influential study on <placeName type="ancient">Numidia</placeName>, but the ‘cantonnement’ model remains central to her presentation.<note n="478"> Fentress 1979, 72-73. </note> She does consider the possibility that disputes between indigenous communities and newer Roman owners of large <foreign xml:lang="la">latifundia</foreign> (like <persName>Valeria Aticilla</persName>) or smaller colonial holdings (e.g., veterans settled at <placeName type="ancient">Amaedara</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Madauros</placeName>) may have led to the legates’ intervention, but there is no explicit evidence to this effect either. Whatever degree of mixed nomadism, transhumance and settled agriculture was practiced by the various small clans that made up the <placeName type="ancient">Musulamii</placeName>before or after contact with <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName>, the simple emplacement of authoritative boundary markers cannot be taken as punitive or as indicative of the creation of reservations.<note n="479"> Whittaker 1978, 345-346: “All the evidence really shows is that some of the fractions of the alliance groups were sedentary in certain obviously agricultural regions – which is precisely what could be expected.” </note> Markers bearing indistinguishable texts (apart from the names of parties and officials involved) survive from many areas where the ‘suppression of nomadism’ cannot have been an issue. </p>

<head>Violent Boundary Dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Oea</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Lepcis Magna</placeName></head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, no. 75</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 69-74</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">The classification of this incident as a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> depends upon the intersection of literary and epigraphic sources. Taken on their own, the boundary markers (Texts <ref target="ddoc:25"><bibl><biblScope>21.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="ddoc:26"><bibl><biblScope>21.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) could only be classified as authoritative demarcations.</p>
<p rend="indent">A territorial dispute between the prominent Tripolitanian cities of <placeName type="ancient">Lepcis Magna </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Oea</placeName>coincided with a struggle over the imperial succession and the attendant assassination of the proconsul of Africa in AD 69/70.<note n="261"> Both cities were clearly <foreign xml:lang="la">civitates</foreign> of the Roman province by this time, but their exact statuses with respect to Rome remain unclear. See Mattingly 1994, 50-52. </note> This dispute is particularly important to the present study for two reasons. First, it represents a Roman administrative failure and its significant consequences: the dispute, apparently unaddressed by a distracted imperial administration, ultimately erupted into a war. Secondly, our sources are both literary and documentary, providing us not only with documentation of the dispute, but also with a suggestion of causes and a clear idea of who the Romans felt were the guilty party.</p>
<p rend="indent">It is <persName>Tacitus</persName>, in narrating the assassination of the proconsul of Africa, <persName>L. Calpurnius Piso</persName>, who provides the most extensive account of the dispute.<note n="262"> Tac. Ann. 4.48-50. Text <ref target="ddoc:27"><bibl><biblScope>21.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> is the latter portion of chapter 50, which describes the dispute itself. </note> <persName>Piso</persName>’s demise was wrought by auxiliary troops on the order of <persName>C. Valerius Festus</persName>, then legate in command of <placeName type="ancient">Legio III Augusta</placeName>. The murder, carried out in <persName>Piso</persName>’s house in <placeName type="modern">Carthage</placeName>, was allegedly provoked by public disorder in the city, the withdrawal of the proconsul from his public duties, suspicions of his intentions regarding the imperial succession, and <persName>Festus’</persName> own desire to distance himself from a previously close relationship with <persName>Vitellius</persName>. The public uproar in <placeName type="modern">Carthage</placeName> had been provoked by the arrival of a centurion allegedly sent by <persName>C. Licinius Mucianus</persName> who “went on and on in a loud voice praising <persName>Piso</persName> as if he were the <foreign xml:lang="la">princeps</foreign>, and admonishing the bystanders … that they should applaud these praises.” For his trouble, the centurion met execution on <persName>Piso</persName>’s order, but the clamor of the <placeName type="modern">Carthaginians,</placeName> who had gathered in the forum and demanded <persName>Piso</persName>’s presence—possibly to hail him as emperor?—led <persName>Piso</persName> to barricade himself in his house and “not even to carry out his accustomed duties.” <persName>Tacitus</persName>implies that <persName>Festus</persName> was nervous about his command, and feared that the legion might join in a public acclamation of <persName>Piso</persName>: <persName>Festus</persName> awaited word of the assassination at <placeName type="ancient">Hadrumetum</placeName>, then “hurried to the legion,” where he took various disciplinary actions consistent with the suppression of military unrest.<note n="263"> Brice 2002, 94-95. </note> In any case, it is this collapse of Roman administration in <placeName type="modern">North Africa</placeName> that permitted a simmering border dispute to erupt into full-blown warfare, which <persName>Festus</persName>ultimately had to resolve by force of arms.</p>
<p rend="indent">The <persName>Elder Pliny</persName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:331"><bibl><biblScope>21.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) reinforces the perception that the Romans blamed <placeName type="ancient">Oea</placeName> for the affair, writing about “the last war, which was waged against the <placeName type="ancient">Oeenses</placeName> at the beginning of <persName>Vespasian</persName>’s reign.” Certainly the step of making an alliance with a militarily capable people from beyond the Roman sphere, and invoking their aid in attacking another important city with close ties to <placeName type="modern">Rome,</placeName> vitiated whatever arguments the <placeName type="modern">Oeans</placeName>might have been able to cite in their own favor in the boundary dispute. But the real failure here is that of the Roman administration itself. With its decision-makers distracted or incapacitated by the high-level struggle for power, provincial administration, at least in <placeName type="modern">North Africa</placeName>, shuddered to a halt.</p>
<p rend="indent">In AD 74, a well-attested but enigmatic imperial legate, <persName>C. Rutilius Gallicus</persName>, placed boundary markers between the territories of the two cities, apparently bringing the affair to a legal end as well.<note n="264"> <persName>Gallicus’</persName> role and mission in <placeName type="modern">North Africa</placeName> are a matter of speculation. See the Prosopographical Index, s.v. “Iulius Cordinus Caius Rutilius Gallicus” for discussion and references. </note> Only two markers are known to survive, and neither was published until 1979 (Texts <ref target="ddoc:25"><bibl><biblScope>21.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> — <ref target="ddoc:26"><bibl><biblScope>21.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).<note n="265"> Also in AD 74, <persName>Gallicus</persName>, in cooperation with the imperial legate in command of <foreign xml:lang="la">legio III Augusta</foreign>, carried out a redemarcation of the <placeName type="ancient">Fossa Regia</placeName> (see Instance <ref target="#INST25"><bibl><biblScope>83</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), but any relationship between the two activities remains uncertain. </note> </p>
<p rend="indent">A much-discussed reference to the “tribute of Libya” in Statius’ later poem about <persName>Gallicus</persName> is often brought to bear on the question of his role in these matters, but it is too elliptical to be conclusive (Text <ref target="ddoc:332"><bibl><biblScope>21.5</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).</p>
<p rend="indent">Tacitus and Pliny make clear the character and consequences of the dispute, but without the boundary markers we would be left to wonder whether the matter had constituted simple theft of resources (a violation of borders) rather than a dispute over the location of the boundaries themselves. Conversely, the language of the boundary markers is indistinguishable from that employed on other markers classified herein as no more than authoritative demarcations.<note n="266"> See, for example, the various authoritative demarcations of the territory of the Musulamii and their neighbors (Instance <ref target="#INST4"><bibl><biblScope>89</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). </note> Without Tacitus and Pliny, we could not be confident in associating these markers with a dispute.<note n="267"> Some caution is still warranted: Gallicus may have summarily established a new boundary, inflicting punishment on <placeName type="ancient">Oea </placeName>through loss of territory, rather than simply adjudicating and properly marking the original boundary; but Di Vita-Evrard 1979, 89-92 argues, partly on the basis of distance measurements on Tiberian-era milestones, that what Gallicus marked was a long-standing boundary between the two cities’ territories. </note> Taken together, all the evidence characterizes this incident as similar, in origins and nature, to a long-running dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName> that had involved the seizure of grazing animals pastured on land claimed by both parties.<note n="268"> Instance <ref target="#INST66"><bibl><biblScope>43</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, Texts <ref target="ddoc:449"><bibl><biblScope>43.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:451"><bibl><biblScope>43.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note></p>

<head>Restoration of Boundaries between the <placeName type="ancient">Nybgenii</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Tacapitani</placeName></head>
<p>Date(s): <date/></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">Epigraphic evidence attests to a massive centuriation effort in central <placeName type="modern">Tunisia</placeName> in AD 29 or 30 (Text <ref target="ddoc:338"><bibl><biblScope>87.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>— Text <ref target="ddoc:29"><bibl><biblScope>87.16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). During the third year of <persName>C. Vibius Marsus’</persName> service as proconsul, <placeName type="ancient">Legio III Augusta</placeName>carried out an extensive survey, evidently centered on high terrain to the northeast of <placeName type="ancient">Ammaedara</placeName> and extending at least 250 km to the southeast. Two other inscriptions (Text <ref target="ddoc:43"><bibl><biblScope>87.17</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>— Text <ref target="ddoc:44"><bibl><biblScope>87.18</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) indicate that, sometime later during the reign of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName>, a copy of an existing survey map was obtained from <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName> and used to reestablish a boundary between the <placeName type="ancient">Nybgenii</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Tacapitani</placeName>, probably in the course of resolving a dispute. Scholars generally assume that the map in question derived from the delimitation under <persName>Marsus</persName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">All the boundary markers associated with these two events that have been recovered come from a 2,400 km<seg type="T25">2</seg> area of the <placeName type="modern">Bled Segui</placeName>, a valley centered on the ancient <placeName type="ancient">Lacus Salinarum</placeName>and roughly bounded by the ancient settlements of <placeName type="ancient">Capsa</placeName>, <placeName type="ancient">Turris Tamalleni </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Aquae Tacapitanae</placeName>.<note n="465"> BAtlas 33 C4-D4 and 35 A1-B1 </note> Twenty-one boundary markers probably deriving from the original survey (5 of then uninscribed) have so far been published, as well as the two from the subsequent Trajanic redemarcation.</p>
<p rend="indent">The inscribed survey markers of AD 29-30 bear coordinates relative to the main axes of the centuriation grid: the <foreign xml:lang="la">cardo maximus</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">decumanus maximus</foreign>. These coordinates indicate the locations of the marker within the grid of centuriation (these range from 55-110 centuries to the right of the <foreign xml:lang="la">decumanus</foreign> and 235-305 centuries beyond the <foreign xml:lang="la">cardo</foreign>, with one bearing coordinates of 45 to the left of the <foreign xml:lang="la">decumanus</foreign>). One of these inscribed boundary markers also carries the annotation NYBG, which has been variously supplemented as <foreign xml:lang="la">Nybg(enii) </foreign>or <foreign xml:lang="la">Nybg(eniorum)</foreign>. Whatever the precise case of the name, it seems likely that this annotation was meant to indicate one of two things: that the century thus marked (or a portion thereof) contained land that belonged to (or had been assigned to) the <placeName type="ancient">Nybgenii</placeName> (i.e., public land of the <placeName type="ancient">Nybgenii</placeName>), or that the <foreign xml:lang="la">limes</foreign> on which the marker stood also constituted a territorial boundary between the <placeName type="ancient">Nybgenii</placeName> and another community or people. Or it indicates that both conditions coincided.</p>
<p rend="indent">In his definitive study of the centuriation, P. Trousset calculates from the relative position of the inscribed markers that the centuriation grid was composed of square centuries measuring approximately 710 m on a side.<note n="466"> See Trousset 1978 with Trousset 1997. </note> Leaving out the one marker from the left side of the <foreign xml:lang="la">decumanus maximus</foreign>, this means we have direct epigraphic evidence for the survey covering an area measuring 55 x 70 centuries (39.1 x 49.7 km). Further, by using the dimensions of the centuries and the coordinates of the surviving markers, it is possible to extrapolate the location of the grid’s origin. These calculations put the <foreign xml:lang="la">decumanus maximus</foreign> nearly 40 km away from the lowest-numbered marker, and the <foreign xml:lang="la">cardo maximus</foreign> nearly 167 km away. Given these distances and the angular alignments of the surviving markers, Trousset accordingly locates the origin atop the <placeName type="modern">Jebel bou el Hanèche</placeName>, a prominent peak just to the northeast of <placeName type="modern">Sidi-Ali-bou-Khraled</placeName>, where there is evidence for an ancient settlement and a road.<note n="467"> See BAtlas 33 C1, where the settlement is marked and the unlabeled peak indicated only by contour lines. </note> From there, the <foreign xml:lang="la">decumanus maximus</foreign> would have run to the southeast at an angle of approximately 35 degrees from south, taking it near <placeName type="ancient">Sufetula</placeName>. The <foreign xml:lang="la">cardo maximus</foreign> would have run at a right angle to the <foreign xml:lang="la">decumanus</foreign>, taking it near <placeName type="ancient">Ammaedara</placeName>, the winter camp of the legion from at least AD 14.<note n="468"> Fentress 1979, 66; Le Bohec 1989, 341-342. </note> Prior to the publication of Trousset’s study, the centuriation of AD 29-30 was thought to be part of an even larger, hypothetical system embracing the whole of southern <placeName type="modern">Tunisia</placeName>. Trousset soundly repudiates this view by comparing the orientation and grid size of this segment with those in other areas, though it is clear that the scheme was still large.</p>
<p rend="indent">The two Trajanic inscriptions were in very poor condition when recovered. It is clear that both were labelled as <foreign xml:lang="la">termini inter Tacapitanos et Nybgenios</foreign>and that each carried a similar text beginning with the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">ex auctoritate imperatoris.</foreign> The imperial titulature is that of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName>, but it is not expressed fully enough to provide a precise date. The name of the individual responsible for reestablishing the boundary has been lost, but he did so on the basis of a map (<foreign xml:lang="la">forma</foreign>) sent by the emperor. The orientation of these boundary markers was important, for opposite sides were clearly labelled with the names of the appropriate parties: the <placeName type="ancient">Nybgenii</placeName> on one side, the <placeName type="ancient">Tacapitani</placeName> on the other. The findspots of these markers, and the orientation of their faces, accord well with the earlier centuriation grid as reconstructed by Trousset; hence the common assumption that the map mentioned in the Trajanic inscriptions depicted the survey as conducted under <persName>Marsus</persName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">There is no direct evidence linking the centuriation of AD 29-30 to any particular dispute or to any particular military or administrative actions, nor would we expect there to be such a linkage. Most modern commentators interpret the survey as a consequence of the revolt of <persName>Tacfarinas</persName> and a major escalation in an already aggressive assertion of Roman control over the region, signalled in preceding years by the establishment of the legion at <placeName type="ancient">Ammaedara</placeName> and the construction of a road from there to <placeName type="ancient">Tacape</placeName>. In the view of Trousset and others,<note n="469"> E.g., Hitchner 1994, 32-33. Cf. Instance <ref target="#INST4"><bibl><biblScope>89</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> the centuriation was a political and military measure taken to punish those native peoples that supported <persName>Tacfarinas,</persName> by limiting their territorial control and establishing a basis for future administration, land appropriation and tax assessment. Whether this centuriation scheme was thoroughly marked on the ground in all areas between its origin and the <placeName type="modern">Bled Segui</placeName>—where the territory of the <placeName type="ancient">Nybgenii</placeName> abutted that of the <placeName type="ancient">Tacapitani</placeName>—is a matter of speculation. The published analyses employing aerial photography do not yet extend this far to the south, so that it is impossible for us to assess the degree to which this grid left a lasting impact on the organization and exploitation of the landscape. That a land dispute could be settled at least 70 years later on the basis of the map held in the imperial archives recording the original survey indicates that the issue was not without some long-term importance.</p>
<p rend="indent">NB: in the following presentation of texts, I have followed Trousset 1978 + Trousset 1997. Because his presentation is definitive, I have not felt it necessary to provide a full list of editions (lemma) or findspots for each stone. I have provided only one example text for each type of inscription, and have not listed at all the five “mute” stones cataloged by Trousset (1978 pp. 176-177 nos. 2-3, 8, 13, 16).</p>

<p type="treDisputeStatement">Two identical boundary markers from the area of <placeName type="ancient">Musti</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Henchir-Mest</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Tunisia</placeName>) commemorate the resolution of a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi>sometime during the reign of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus Pius</persName>. The markers derive their legal authority from the emperor (<foreign xml:lang="la">ex auctoritate</foreign>) and stem from his legal decision (<foreign xml:lang="la">ex sententia</foreign>).</p>
<p rend="indent">The unique phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio facta publica</foreign> (a public boundary determination has been made) ties the markers to a specific legal investigation and description of <placeName type="ancient">Musti’s</placeName> boundaries that would have been recorded in a legal document to ensure its lasting validity and accessibility. The explicitness of this relationship between legal document and boundary marker would have facilitated future verification of the markers and their locations (if fraud or repositioning was suspected) in the very manner described by the agrimensores.<note n="339"> Campbell 2000, 32.30-34.35. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">The emphasis on a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign>, and the use of <foreign xml:lang="la">cippi</foreign> (i.e., boundary markers) to carry it, indicates that the case focused at least in part on boundaries. It is therefore likely that <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Pius’</persName> verdict consisted primarily in delegating authority for resolution of the dispute, as well as survey and description of the boundaries, to an appropriate official in the province. In other cases, this official is often indicated on the boundary marker. Here, we would be expected to have recourse to a public copy of the <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> to learn such details. It may well be that the <placeName type="ancient">Mustitani</placeName> petitioned the emperor for assistance in dealing with encroachments on their territory by other communities or extra-civic <foreign xml:lang="la">latifundia</foreign>, and the emperor responded by ordering a survey and the creation of a legally valid, public boundary description, accompanied by the placement of corresponding boundary markers.<note n="340"> The present inscriptions were discovered along the ridgeline of the <placeName type="modern">Djebel Bou Khil </placeName>to the south of <placeName type="ancient">Musti</placeName>. Two imperial estates, one to the northeast and one to the southeast, probably bordered <placeName type="ancient">Musti’s </placeName><foreign xml:lang="la">territorium</foreign>, with the <placeName type="ancient">Fossa Regia </placeName>providing an eastern border. Summary and citations: Beschaouch 1968, 135-137, with sketch map. </note> We can assume that this process would have taken into account any available earlier markers, maps, documents and testimony. That a public <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> was explicitly required implies that pre-existing documentation had been inadequate to prevent problems or resolve disputes. It is a pity that the text of the emperor’s legal decision, together with the text of the <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> itself and other related documents, have not come down to us. That such an inscribed dossier once existed seems likely, given examples from <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName>, <placeName type="ancient">Istria</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>.<note n="341"> Instances <ref target="#INST16"><bibl><biblScope>39</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, <ref target="#INST21"><bibl><biblScope>16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="#INST66"><bibl><biblScope>43</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note></p>

<head>Verdicts of <persName>Avidius Nigrinus</persName> in Boundary Disputes Concerning <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName> and Neighboring Communities</head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, nos. 67, 68, 69 and 70</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 117?</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">Sometime around AD 117, a series of documents were inscribed on the south wall of the temple of Apollo at <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName>. These documents, originally presented in Latin with complete Greek translations, survive today in varying degrees of fragmentation. They relate to at least three verdicts promulgated by <persName>C. Avidius Nigrinus</persName>, a propraetorian legate of an emperor, probably <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName>. He pronounced these verdicts after judging disputes between <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName> and her neighbors in September and early October (probably of AD 117).</p>
<p rend="indent"><persName>Nigrinus’</persName> role in Greece is ambiguous. He may have been serving as a special legate of the emperor, in lieu of the traditional proconsul, or he may have functioned as a special corrector, sent by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName> to assist the free cities of Greece in resolving disputes and handling other issues.</p>
<p rend="indent">In the first decision (Text <ref target="ddoc:302"><bibl><biblScope>39.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>and Text <ref target="ddoc:303"><bibl><biblScope>39.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), <persName>Nigrinus </persName>confirmed an earlier verdict in a dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Delphi </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Ambryssos</placeName>. The original complaint had been brought before an unnamed emperor and delegated by him to the famous jurist <persName>C. Cassius Longinus</persName>. That case (Instance <ref target="#INST135"><bibl><biblScope>44</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), which is otherwise unattested, must have occurred sometime between AD 41 (the accession of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Claudius</persName>) and AD 65 (when <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Nero </persName>exiled the blind lawyer to <placeName type="ancient">Sardinia </placeName>in the aftermath of the Pisonian conspiracy). In reconfirming <persName>Longinus’ </persName>verdict, <persName>Nigrinus </persName>reiterated the validity of a then-extant <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign>, which had been made under <persName>Longinus’ </persName>direction by the surveyor <persName>Valerius Iustus</persName>. In this verdict, <persName>Nigrinus </persName>does not make it clear why the case was reopened or how it came under his jurisdiction. The land in question, and the relevant evidence, seem to have been unrelated to the amphyctionic verdicts cited by <persName>Nigrinus </persName>in his other two rulings (or perhaps the decision of <persName>Longinus </persName>had explicitly superseded all earlier rulings). <persName>Nigrinus </persName>makes a point of observing that neither <placeName type="ancient">Delphi </placeName>nor <placeName type="ancient">Ambryssos </placeName>had disputed <persName>Longinus’ </persName>decision for a number of years, thereby implicitly acceding to its validity.</p>
<p rend="indent"><persName>Nigrinus </persName>settled the second dispute five days later in a verdict formally presented at <placeName type="ancient">Elatia </placeName>(Text <ref target="ddoc:304"><bibl><biblScope>39.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and Text <ref target="ddoc:305"><bibl><biblScope>39.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). He makes it clear that this boundary dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Delphi </placeName>and its neighbors <placeName type="ancient">Amphissa </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Myania </placeName>had first been brought before <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName>, who had delegated it to him with orders to “stand by the judgement of the hieromnemones that was made on the authority of <persName>Manius Acilius </persName>and the Senate” (<foreign xml:lang="la">cum hieromnemonum iudicio {quod} ex auctor[itate Ma]ni Acili et senatus facto op[ti]mus princeps stari iusserit</foreign>). In this context, <persName>Nigrinus </persName>cites a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio </foreign>made by the hieromnemones, “inscribed on the side of the temple of Apollo,” and formulates his ruling in accordance with it. There seems to have been some debate about the interpretation of the older <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign>, for <persName>Nigrinus </persName>goes to greater length in explaining his decision than in the case of the <persName>Longinus</persName>/<persName>Iustus </persName><foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign>: both parties had been heard “many times,” a formal <foreign xml:lang="la">demonstratio </foreign>of the boundaries had been made, both parties had taken the opportunity to inspect the territory in question (in particular, those areas where they were in disagreement), and “documents pertaining to the case” had been carefully assessed. Because the old <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio </foreign>required interpretation, <persName>Nigrinus </persName>provided – as part of his verdict – an annotated version in which he explained his interpretations and the evidence he had found to support them.</p>
<p rend="indent">Nineteen days later, at <placeName type="ancient">Eleusis</placeName>, Nigrinus delivered a third verdict (Text <ref target="ddoc:306"><bibl><biblScope>39.5</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and Text <ref target="ddoc:307"><bibl><biblScope>39.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), resolving a boundary dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Delphi </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Anticyra </placeName>over “the area sacred to Pythian Apollo.” As in the verdict delivered at <placeName type="ancient">Elatia</placeName>, <persName>Nigrinus </persName>signals delegation from <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan </persName>with an injunction to respect the earlier hieromnemonic decision. He reiterates many of the additional points made in the previous verdict, going to even greater lengths in explaining the need for additional investigation: “a more diligent investigation was therefore made necessary by the great antiquity of the matter, both because the possessio of certain places has changed and because the names of areas which are contained in the <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio </foreign>of the hieromnemones are hardly known now because of the passage of time, and because both parties have transcribed them for their own advantage.” This verdict also included an annotated version of the <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio </foreign>in question.</p>
<p rend="indent">A number of other fragments, too small or enigmatic to provide much additional information, also survive (Text <ref target="ddoc:308"><bibl><biblScope>39.7</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>-Text <ref target="ddoc:370"><bibl><biblScope>39.10</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). At least one of these appears to have been a letter from <persName>Nigrinus </persName>to the Delphians.</p>

<p type="treDisputeStatement">The epigraphic record of <placeName type="ancient">Dalmatia</placeName> preserves several texts relating to the territorial boundary between <placeName type="ancient">Nedinum</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Nadin</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Croatia</placeName>) and <placeName type="ancient">Corinium</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Karin</placeName>). Despite problems in the modern transmission and publication of these texts, we can be confident in identifying here a restoration of boundaries or boundary markers (<foreign xml:lang="la">restituti</foreign> with no antecedent expressed) that had been established according to the edict of an earlier governor.</p>
<p rend="indent">The two most complete texts date to the tenure of <persName>A. Ducenius Geminus</persName>, who served as governor sometime between AD 62 and 68. One of these texts (Text <ref target="ddoc:178"><bibl><biblScope>3.5</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) was found at <placeName type="modern">Popović</placeName> (<placeName type="modern">Benkovac</placeName>). It records the restoration of at least a portion of the boundary as previously demarcated according to an edict of the governor <persName>P. Cornelius Dolabella</persName> (c. AD 14-20).<note n="233"> On the use of an edict, see page <bibl><biblScope type="page">30</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl>. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">Another text, preserved only in a Renaissance manuscript, apparently also records Geminus’ use of the same two centurions to establish boundaries between <placeName type="ancient">Nedinum </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Corinium</placeName>, but makes no mention of <persName>Dolabella’s</persName> earlier ruling (Text <ref target="ddoc:463"><bibl><biblScope>3.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). There is some uncertainty on the part of modern scholars as to whether this reported document should be connected to a fragmentary version of what appears to be the same text, discovered in <placeName type="modern">Pridraga (Zadar)</placeName>. It was first published in 1902 and was still extant as late as the 1970s (Text <ref target="ddoc:181"><bibl><biblScope>3.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). If we accept the manuscript testimony as accurate (the extant inscribed document does not preserve the names of the parties to the dispute), then the omission of any mention of <persName>Dolabella’s</persName> earlier demarcation seems odd. Did <persName>Dolabella</persName> resolve a dispute between the two cities regarding only a portion of their common border, or had some subsequent activity rendered his decision obsolete for a portion of the boundary? The second text does indicate that new measurements of some kind were required under <persName>Geminus</persName>; there is no such mention of direct survey in the first text. It is of course equally possible that the manuscript version incorporates antiquarian embellishment on the preserved text now at <placeName type="modern">Pridraga</placeName>, and the text should be seen as representing a different settlement involving the same Roman personnel, but between two parties whose names are irrevocably lost, and who may have been one or the other, or neither of the <placeName type="ancient">Neditae</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Corinienses</placeName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">Two other inscriptions, one fragmentary and the other laconic, are often cited together with the decisions of <persName>Geminus</persName>, but there is no certainty that they are related to this incident (Texts <ref target="ddoc:312"><bibl><biblScope>3.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>and <ref target="ddoc:461"><bibl><biblScope>3.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). Neither one provides any useful information about Roman administrative practice with respect to boundary disputes.</p>

<p>Date(s): <date>c. AD 47-102</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">A dispute between the city of <placeName type="ancient">Histria</placeName> and the contractor who had purchased the <foreign xml:lang="la">portorium ripae Thraciae</foreign> over the rights to tax revenues required an <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi> by the governor of <placeName type="ancient">Moesia Inferior</placeName> as part of his verdict in the case.</p>
<p rend="indent">This important dossier widens our understanding of boundary disputes in several ways. It demonstrates that boundary disputes could arise in the context of larger disagreements over resource exploitation, taxation and traditional civic rights. It also reveals a proactive pattern of behavior on the part of a provincial city whereby each successive Roman governor was petitioned to confirm in writing the city’s claim to extract resources from a particular area. The success of this strategy – proved by the city’s victory in a later dispute that also resulted in the definitive demarcation of the area in question – may indicate that the careful maintenance of documentation for rights and associated boundaries was not an uncommon civic preoccupation.</p>
<p rend="indent">These documents attest to the long-running concern of the city of <placeName type="ancient">Histria</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Istria</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Romania</placeName>) for its ancestral rights to tax the revenue from fishing and other activities at one mouth of the <placeName type="modern">Danube</placeName> delta, called <placeName type="ancient">Peuke</placeName>.  Our evidence for <placeName type="ancient">Histria’s</placeName> interaction with the governors of the province of <placeName type="ancient">Moesia Inferior </placeName>on this subject was inscribed in the early years of the second century. It consists of two blocks, each over a meter and a half tall, and each bearing an inscribed copy of a dossier of letters and verdicts from successive Roman governors, spanning the period from c. AD 47 to AD 102. Both blocks, found separately in different parts of the delta, have suffered significant damage. It is therefore ncessary for scholars to cross-supplement their texts one from the other in order to arrive at what is clearly an identical source text for each. In the presentation that follows, I have provided for each letter the most complete text. References to the alternate copy are also included.</p>
<p rend="indent">Like the documents on the ‘archive wall’ from <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>,<note n="255"> <seg type="T18">Instance </seg><seg type="T18"><ref target="#INST66"><bibl><biblScope>43</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref></seg><seg type="T18">.</seg> </note> these texts were inscribed not in chronological order, but according to another scheme. The dossier opens with one of the two latest documents: a Latin <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio </foreign>(entitled<foreign xml:lang="la">  </foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁροθεσία</foreign><foreign xml:lang="la"><seg type="T6">  </seg></foreign>in the inscribed Greek heading) <seg type="T6">ordered</seg> by the governor <persName>M’. Laberius Maximus </persName>(c. AD 100, Text <ref target="ddoc:314"><bibl><biblScope>16.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). The dossier closes with the text of <persName>Maximus’ </persName>verdict (Text <ref target="ddoc:320"><bibl><biblScope>16.7</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) in a lawsuit brought against against the <placeName type="modern">Histrians</placeName> by the contractor who had purchased the <foreign xml:lang="la">portorium ripae Thraciae </foreign>for the taxes (<foreign xml:lang="la">portorium</foreign>) from <placeName type="ancient">Halmyris </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Peucus</placeName> ( = <placeName type="ancient">Peuke</placeName>). On the model of the <persName>Nigrinus</persName> dossier from <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName>,<note n="256"> Instance <ref target="#INST116"><bibl><biblScope>61</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> we should probably view the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁροθεσία</foreign> as the conclusion (or an annex) to <persName>Maximus’</persName> verdict. The two were split – and the <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁροθεσία</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign>placed first – for rhetorical purposes when inscribed by the <placeName type="modern">Histrians</placeName>. Between these two bookends, we are given the series of letters from previous governors that must have formed part of the evidentiary dossier presented by the <placeName type="modern">Histrian</placeName> advocates as they argued their case before <persName>Maximus</persName>. The logic guiding the order in which these documents are presented is obscure. Read chronologically, however, they reveal that each successive governor was called upon to confirm <placeName type="ancient">Histria’s </placeName>ancestral rights (originally confirmed by ‘the emperor,’ who is not named). The governors’ letters of confirmation are clearly responses to petitions presented by <placeName type="modern">Histrian</placeName>delegations that met each governor upon his arrival in the province. It is also clear from at least one letter of the governor <persName>(T.) Flavius Sabinus </persName>(c. AD 53-60) that some kind of dispute about the rights in question had arisen prior to <persName>Maximus’ </persName>decision and had required enforcement by a Roman prefect (Text <ref target="ddoc:315"><bibl><biblScope>16.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). The exact nature of this earlier dispute is unclear.</p>
<p rend="indent">The earliest letter (Text <ref target="ddoc:319"><bibl><biblScope>16.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) in the <placeName type="ancient">Histria</placeName> dossier was addressed to the <placeName type="modern">Histrians</placeName>by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Claudius’</persName> legate <persName>C. Terentius Tullius Geminus</persName>, who probably served a three-year term in the province from AD 50-53. It responds to concerns expressed by an eleven-man delegation that met <persName>Geminus</persName> in <placeName type="ancient">Tomis</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Constanţa</placeName>, <placeName type="modern">Romania</placeName>) on his arrival in the province. He confirms their view that <placeName type="ancient">Histria’s</placeName> ancestral boundaries (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">[ ... </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">τὰ</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">προ</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">]</seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">γόνων</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑμῶν</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρια</foreign>) at <placeName type="ancient">Peuke</placeName> should be preserved.</p>
<p rend="indent">The dossier also contains two letters of <persName>(T.) Flavius Sabinus</persName> (Texts <ref target="ddoc:316"><bibl><biblScope>16.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="ddoc:315"><bibl><biblScope>16.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), who next governed the province of <placeName type="ancient">Moesia</placeName> for a term of seven years (ca. AD 53-60). These two letters are probably inscribed in reverse chronological order; they appear third and second, respectively. The letter inscribed first relates to enforcement of an earlier verdict (clearly that delivered in the other letter), and in it <persName>Sabinus</persName> promises to inform his successor about the matter. Although the earlier letter (Text <ref target="ddoc:315"><bibl><biblScope>16.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) carries the heading “another letter of <persName>Sabinus</persName>,” these headings were obviously added at the time of inscription (or presentation as evidence) and so reflect that order.</p>
<p rend="indent">It is possible that Text <ref target="ddoc:316"><bibl><biblScope>16.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>coincides with <persName>Sabinus’</persName> arrival in the province, having been met by a delegation similar to that which met <persName>Geminus</persName>. The letter could equally have been composed later, and absent any formula of date, we cannot know for certain. It is unclear exactly what problems continued later in <persName>Sabinus’ </persName>tenure, but it is clear that there were problems, for he wrote back to <placeName type="ancient">Histria </placeName>concerning the delegation of enforcement responsibilities to another prefect. This letter comes later than the other, for <persName>Sabinus </persName>is anticipating his departure from the province and promising to inform his successor of the situation.</p>
<p rend="indent">The fourth interaction (chronologically) between <placeName type="ancient">Histria </placeName>and a Roman governor is found in a letter of <persName>Plautius Aelianus</persName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:318"><bibl><biblScope>16.5</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), <persName>Sabinus’ </persName>immediate successor, whose tenure in <placeName type="ancient">Moesia </placeName>probably lasted from AD 60 to 67. It would appear that this letter also was prompted by the appearance of a <placeName type="modern">Histrian</placeName>delegation upon the governor’s arrival in the province. He presumably knew to expect them, given <persName>Sabinus’ </persName>prior promise to inform him of the matter. This is the only letter of <persName>Aelianus </persName>in the dossier, so the implication of the heading (“another letter of <persName>Aelianus</persName>”) appears to have been a mistake by the compiler of the dossier or by the lapicide.</p>
<p rend="indent">The <placeName type="modern">Histrians</placeName> continued their practice of securing each new governor’s observance of their ancestral rights. <persName>C. Pomponius Pius</persName>, <persName>Aelianus’</persName> immediate successor as governor of <placeName type="ancient">Moesia Inferior </placeName>(ca. AD 67-68) acknowledged those rights as well, having seen the relevant correspondence of the two previous governors (Text <ref target="ddoc:317"><bibl><biblScope>16.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).</p>
<p rend="indent">The <placeName type="modern">Histrians’</placeName> assiduous practice of extracting such letters from each governor paid off some 30 years later when <persName>Charagonius Philopalaestrus</persName> brought his lawsuit. Although most of the detailed portion of <persName>Maximus’</persName>verdict (Text <ref target="ddoc:320"><bibl><biblScope>16.7</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) is lost, it seems clear from the overall character of the dossier, and the manner of its inscription, that the <placeName type="modern">Histrians</placeName> felt they had won the case and had secured from <persName>Maximus</persName> and his predecessors essential documentation (not least a surveyed boundary description) and vindication of a venerable and important source of revenue.</p>
<p rend="indent">A separate fragmentary inscription, with lettering very similar to the two boundary stelae, preserves a small part of what may be another governor’s letter (in Latin and Greek copies). It mentions a <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">boule </seg>and <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">demos</seg>, <placeName type="ancient">Histria</placeName>, and Aruntius Flamma, the prefect mentioned in Text <ref target="ddoc:315"><bibl><biblScope>16.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>.

<head>Restoration of Public Places at <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii</placeName></head>
<p>Date(s): <date/></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">Three boundary markers from <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii</placeName> bearing identical texts attest to the intervention of a tribune of the praetorian guard who, on the emperor’s authority, restored to civic control public lands that had been occupied by private persons. That this task entailed the resolution of more than one <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> is confirmed by the text’s indication that cases were heard and surveys made (<foreign xml:lang="la">causis cognitis et mensuris factis</foreign>).</p>
<p rend="indent">The career of this tribune, <persName>T. Suedius Clemens</persName>, as well as his activities in <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii</placeName>, are documented by a number of disparate sources.<note n="390"> See now Jiménez de Furundarena 1999 and Franklin 2001, 156-194, both with complementary sources, literature and discussion. The following discussion of Clemens’ role at <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii </placeName>is heavily dependent upon Franklin’s presentation and arguments. </note> He first comes to our attention as an infamous <foreign xml:lang="la">primus pilus </foreign>of the praetorians under <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Otho</persName> in AD 69, and vanishes again after memorializing a visit (now <foreign xml:lang="la">praefectus castrorum</foreign>) to the colossus of Memnon in Egypt in AD 79. Surviving electoral notices at <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii</placeName> reveal that <persName>Clemens</persName> played a role in local politics during his tenure there, which can be no more securely dated than some time shortly before the eruption of <placeName type="modern">Mt. Vesuvius </placeName>in AD 79. He endorsed a man named <persName>M. Epidius Sabinus </persName>for the office of duovir. The notices in question style <persName>Clemens</persName> as <foreign xml:lang="la">sanctus</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">sanctissimus</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> (sacred judge).<note n="391"> <seg type="T33">CIL 4.1059 = Franklin 2001, 158.166, CIL 4.768 = Franklin 2001, 159.168, CIL 4.7579 = Franklin 2001, 159.169.</seg> </note> On another notice, wherein Clemens’ title is not made explicit, <persName>Clemens’</persName> endorsement is characterized as a sententia: <foreign xml:lang="la">M. Epidium Sabinum ex sententia Suedi Clementis Sabinus d(uo) v(irum) i(ure) d(icundo) o(ro) v(os) f(aciatis)</foreign>.<note n="392"> CIL 4.791 = Franklin 2001, 158.167. </note> The use of this term may have been intended to evoke Clemens’ judicial role as well. For his part, <persName>Sabinus</persName> is elsewhere styled <foreign xml:lang="la">defensor coloniae</foreign>, a title that may indicate he served as a <foreign xml:lang="la">causidicus</foreign> (case pleader) before <persName>Clemens’</persName>tribunal.</p>
<p rend="indent">We would of course like to know more about <persName>Clemens’</persName> activities and relationships with the local elites of <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii</placeName>, but even as it stands his is by far the most illuminating legacy of any of the <foreign xml:lang="la">iudices </foreign>known to have been involved in boundary disputes during the empire. It seems clear that the issue of <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii’s</placeName>public spaces was a very sensitive one. <persName>Clemens</persName> seems to have had a significant public profile, and to have engaged with members of the local elite in a dynamic way over an extended period of time. Whether we should take his relationship with <persName>Sabinus</persName> in the electoral notices as indicating that he was highly regarded throughout the community as a result of his work remains unclear. It depends on whether we take these electoral notices as the work of the candidate, or of his opponents. L. Acilius Strabo, who carried out a similar mission with respect to Roman public lands in <placeName type="ancient">Cyrenaica</placeName>, was prosecuted before the Senate by the provincials.<note n="393"> Instance <ref target="#INST183"><bibl><biblScope>62</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> If <persName>Clemens</persName> was widely disliked for his role, a reported verdict in favor of a particular candidate on the part of the ‘most revered’ judge might not reflect well on the recipient.</p>
<p rend="indent">The contexts in which these markers were placed provide some additional information about the nature of <persName>Clemens’</persName> commission.<note n="394"> The following discussion derives from the findings of Kathryn McDonnell, which she has been kind enough to share with me in advance of publication. See my notes on the context of each marker below. </note> They all occupy prominent positions just outside the city gates and coordinate spatially with a zone of clear space, tombs, statues and pathways that encircle the city just outside the walls. Some of the monuments carry inscriptions indicating that the monument was placed in accordance with a decree of the decurions or that the space had been explicitly granted for the purpose (<foreign xml:lang="la">locus datus</foreign>), a clear indication that civic public space in this area was being legally granted for the construction of tombs and the erection of monuments. At the <seg type="treForeign">Porta di Vesuvio</seg>, a number of uninscribed cippi survive, demarcating the edge of the road and some divisions between tombs. Clearly, <persName>Clemens’</persName>task was to oversee a review of all occupation in this zone, and to judge on the basis of available evidence which structures and uses had been legally authorized, and whether these legal users had kept their structures within bounds specified in the authorizations.</p>
<p rend="indent">Although we cannot document it, it seems likely that <persName>Clemens’</persName> activities were directly and explicitly delegated to him by the emperor. This delegation presumably would have followed on from a petition brought to the emperor by the Roman colony at <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii</placeName>, requesting his assistance in sorting out a thorny problem that might otherwise provoke significant civic unrest. We should not be surprised by such an approach, since the inhabitants of <placeName type="modern">Italy</placeName> at this period lacked anyone equivalent to a provincial governor they could approach. The pattern is illustrated by the behavior of the people of Nuceria in AD 59, who approached the emperor with their concerns about a riot that had occurred in Pompeii, during which many of their citizens had been killed.<note n="395"> Tac. Ann. 14.17. </note> In that case, Nero referred the matter to the Senate. It may be that by Vespasian’s time is was quite clear that the demarcation of boundaries and related tasks was thoroughly a prerogative of the emperor.<note n="396"> We have only two examples of the Senate’s involvement in land disputes during the principate: Instances <ref target="#INST76"><bibl><biblScope>10</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="#INST94"><bibl><biblScope>64</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. The first of these, involving the temple of Artemis Limnatis had significant pre-imperial antecedents, including action by the Senate during the Republic. The second case, in which the proconsul of <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName> restored to the city of <placeName type="ancient">Gortyn</placeName> <foreign xml:lang="la">praedia publica</foreign>that had been occupied by private persons, was carried out on the combination of the emperor’s authority and a decree of the Senate. The reasons for this unique formulation are obscure. </note> In any case, only the emperor could have assigned an military officer on active service to attend to such a matter. As a special emissary of the emperor, <persName>Clemens’</persName> mission therefore compares with that of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Claudius’</persName> <foreign xml:lang="la">amicus</foreign> <persName>Iulius Planta</persName>, who was sent north to the area of <placeName type="ancient">Comum</placeName> to investigate a complex dispute involving several communities.<note n="397"> Instance <ref target="#INST54"><bibl><biblScope>15</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note></p>

<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Claudius</persName> is described in the text as <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεός</foreign> (god). Taking this together with <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Nero’s</persName> titulature in the magistrates’ titles, most commentators date the boundary action to the early years of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Nero’s</persName> reign (AD 54-55). The inscriptions also record the provision that a fifth part of the <foreign xml:lang="la">usufruct</foreign> on the land belonging to <placeName type="ancient">Tymbrianassos</placeName> was owed to <placeName type="ancient">Sagalassos</placeName>.<note n="438"> The most recent and comprehensive discussion is Horsley 1998, whose treatment and identification of the various texts and editions I follow below. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">G. Burton has cited these documents as evidence in support of his argument that the Roman provincial administration, “characterised by a substantial deficit of administrative resources” occasionally used “procurators for non-fiscal functions.”<note n="439"> Burton 1993, 25-26 with 20-21. </note> In particular, he takes these texts (from an imperial province) as “analogous examples” to others culled from proconsular provinces wherein procurators exercised judiciary authority in cases that ought to have required a governor’s involvement. Burton is of course aware that “the duties of the junior procurators who ran large patrimonial areas within a province no doubt always extended ... to the solution of any communal disputes which might have arisen.”<note n="440"> Burton 1993, 20. </note> Accordingly, he rightly exempts from consideration the placement of <foreign xml:lang="la">termini</foreign> by a freedman procurator near <placeName type="ancient">Synnada</placeName> in <placeName type="ancient">Phrygia</placeName> on the grounds that the land involved was probably patrimonial, i.e., part of an imperial estate over which the procurator had administrative authority.<note n="441"> See Instance <ref target="#INST174"><bibl><biblScope>105</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, which, it should be noted, is not clearly a boundary dispute. </note> But when it comes to the boundary markers near <placeName type="ancient">Sagalassos</placeName>, Burton seems to have missed the significance of the full title given by the texts to what he describes simply as the “village of Tymbrianassus:” <foreign xml:lang="grc">κώμη</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Τυμβριανασσέων</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Νέρωνος</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Κλαυδίου</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Καίσαρος</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Σεβαστοῦ</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Γερμανικοῦ</foreign> (the village of the <placeName type="ancient">Tymbrianasseoi</placeName> of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Nero</persName> Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus). The clear implication of this phraseology – as pointed out by these texts’ editors – is that the village lay within the boundaries of an imperial estate. It is therefore not at all surprising, <seg type="term">pace</seg> Burton, that we should find the procurator involved.</p>
<p type="P21">In fact, these documents reinforce what emerges as a basic principle in Roman adjudication of boundary disputes; namely, that whoever judged the case required judiciary authority over all parties to the case. Neither the governor nor the procurator alone fulfilled this requirement because the boundary in dispute between the two communities was identical with the boundary between the imperial estate and the surrounding province. The lack of an obvious official who embodied the requisite judiciary authority necessitated an approach to the emperor (the next higher authority with sufficient competence), whence <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Claudius’</persName> letter delegating the case to a board of two who, together, possessed the necessary span of authority. It is clear from other examples involving disputes over boundaries between provinces that the emperor could also have chosen to appoint a special legate as <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> in the case.<note n="442"> It is a pity that Burton missed the example of Aichinger 1982, who explains the use of special legates in the provincial boundary cases convincingly. I am aware of only one other situation in which a board of two imperial officials jointly supervised a boundary demarcation: the joint remarking on <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian’s</persName> authority of a small portion of the <placeName type="ancient">Fossa Regia</placeName> by the legate in command of <placeName type="ancient">Legio III Augusta</placeName>and another legate whose exact office remains a matter of speculation (Instance <ref target="#INST25"><bibl><biblScope>83</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). </note></p>

<p type="treDisputeStatement">The motivation and administrative context for the authoritative redemarcation of a small portion of the boundary between the “old” and “new” provinces of <placeName type="ancient">Africa</placeName> during Vespasian’s reign are obscure.</p>
<p rend="indent">All nine surviving markers come from a relatively well-circumscribed geographic area, and one where no physical trace of the ditch itself survives.<note n="457"> For a balanced review and thoughtful discussion, see: EncBerb s.v. “Fossa Regia” by N. Ferchiou, pp. 2900-2910. </note> There is no evidence to indicate that the work was prompted by a boundary dispute. The formula employed in the text (<foreign xml:lang="la">ex auctoritate imperatoris</foreign>) is indistinguishable from that employed on markers erected as the result of verdicts issued in such disputes, as well as boundaries assigned extra-judicially. In this instance, the work was carried out on the authority of the emperor by two imperial legates, <persName>Sex. Sentius Caecilianus </persName>and <persName>C.

That the <foreign xml:lang="la">fossa</foreign> might have divided the jurisdiction of these two officials would help to explain the need for both of them to collaborate in its demarcation.</p>

<p rend="indent">Poinssot thought the style of the lettering was consistent with a date between Hadrian and the Severi.

These individuals may have served on the proconsul’s <foreign xml:lang="la">consilium</foreign>, perhaps in the case in question (the first text indicates that the verdict was issued following consultation with the <foreign xml:lang="la">consilium</foreign>). Poinssot’s dating of the second text relies on speculative identifications of some of the individuals involved, and would put the inscription during the early years of the reign of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Marcus Aurelius</persName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">As Poinssot also noted, the language of the first text is consistent with that found on inscriptions clearly related to verdicts and arbitral decisions in boundary disputes, hence the classification of this text, from which the full preamble is missing. It is possible that the dispute did not concern boundaries; this ambiguity illustrates how completely the judicial resolution of boundary disputes was administratively and procedurally embedded in the standard Roman provincial administrative approach.</p>

<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, no. 59</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 128</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">The procuratorial governor of <placeName type="ancient">Mauretania Caesariensis</placeName> authorized the placement of boundary markers between territory belonging to Roman citizens living in the Augustan colony at <placeName type="ancient">Igilgili</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Jijel</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Algeria</placeName>) and an indigenous people, the <placeName type="ancient">Zimizes</placeName>. The text seems to indicate a demarcation aimed a particular area, rather than an entire civic territory: its ostensible purpose was to clarify for the <placeName type="ancient">Zimizes</placeName> that they could no longer have use of a <foreign xml:lang="la">castellum</foreign> that was within the territory of <placeName type="ancient">Igilgili</placeName>. It is not clear whether this demarcation represents the resolution of a dispute between the two parties or whether the action was administrative (e.g., confiscation of an important facility as punishment for some other misbehavior), and so this incident must remain classified only as an <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi>.</p>
<p rend="indent">The implications and consequences of this demarcation are incompletely understood. An argument has been made for seeing this demarcation as an example of Roman ‘governmental’ policy aimed at the reservation of ‘traditionally tribal’ land for intensive cultivation by Roman colonists.<note n="495"> Kehoe 1988, 207 n. 48. </note> Cultivation cannot be the point of the demarcation, for the inscribed text is clear: only the area enclosed by the wall of the ‘fortlet’<note n="496"> There is a vast and divergent scholarly literature on the topic of <foreign xml:lang="la">castella</foreign> in North Africa. The word seems to have denoted different things at different times to different ancient authors, ranging from ‘fortified place’ or ‘fortlet’ to ‘small, indigenous community.’ It may also have connoted, in some contexts, a hierarchical classification or rank of community. See: Bouchenaki 1977, 196-198, Whittaker 1978, 352-355, Gascou 1983 and Le Bohec 1990. Given the association in this case with a Roman colonial foundation, and the measurements for the <foreign xml:lang="la">castellum</foreign>itself (see note <bibl><biblScope type="note">497</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl>), ‘fortlet’ seems the most acceptable choice. </note> (a mere 500 Roman feet)<note n="497"> If this 500 Roman feet (<foreign xml:lang="la">p(assus) D</foreign>) is a perimeter measurement, the <foreign xml:lang="la">castellum</foreign> will have been something like 125 Roman feet (approximately 121 ft = 37 m) on a side (if assumed to be square) or a circle with a diameter of 160 Roman feet (approximately 155 ft = 47.4 m). The enclosed area will then have been between 1,636 yd<seg type="T19">2</seg> and 2,105 yd<seg type="T19">2</seg> (1,369 m<seg type="T19">2</seg> – 1,762 m<seg type="T19">2</seg>), less than half the area of an NCAA regulation football field (5,333 yd<seg type="T19">2</seg> = 4,459 m<seg type="T19">2</seg>; cf., http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/football/football_field.html). This is just slightly larger in area than one Roman <foreign xml:lang="la">actus quadratus </foreign>(half a <foreign xml:lang="la">iugerum</foreign>): 1,508 yd<seg type="T19">2</seg> = 1,262 m<seg type="T19">2</seg>. </note> was at issue. That the new structure had been built on land to which “the <placeName type="ancient">Zimizes</placeName>, who are generally thought to be mountain neighbours of the <placeName type="ancient">Igilgilitani</placeName>, had [previously] held joint title”<note n="498"> Whittaker 1978, 349. </note> is interesting indeed, but we cannot recover the reasons for this development. <foreign xml:lang="la">Castella</foreign>, such as this one, may well have been a resource of value both to sedentary agriculturalists and the transhumant or nomadic peoples with whom they interacted seasonally.<note n="499"> Around 44 BC a <foreign xml:lang="la">castellum</foreign> was divided by a Roman official: <foreign xml:lang="la">divisit</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="la">inter colonos et Uchitanos</foreign>. These <foreign xml:lang="la">coloni</foreign> are plausibly argued by Whittaker 1978, 354 to have been, not Roman veteran colonists, but “sedentary farmers of the royal Numidian estates” who needed to share the resources of the <foreign xml:lang="la">castellum</foreign> with the ‘possibly transhumant’ <placeName type="ancient">Uchitani</placeName>. There is nothing, <seg type="term">pace</seg> Whittaker, about this fragmentary Republican-era text that proves the division arose from a dispute or arbitration. </note></p>

<head>Restoration of Boundaries and Immunity of the <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses</placeName> by the <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Severi</persName></head>
<p>Date(s): <date/></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">Boundary restoration with no direct evidence of a dispute.</p>
<p rend="indent">An inscription from the area of <placeName type="ancient">Tipasa</placeName> on the North African coast records the restoration of borders associated with a fortified community (<foreign xml:lang="la">castellum</foreign>) belonging to the otherwise unknown <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses</placeName>. The text is datable, by the imperial titulature of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Septimius Severus</persName>, to sometime after 28 January AD 198, when the emperor assumed the title <foreign xml:lang="la">Parthicus maximus</foreign>, and made <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Caracalla</persName> Augustus and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Geta</persName> Caesar. It seems most likely that the text refers to an event occurring in AD 202, when the entire imperial family was in <placeName type="modern">North Africa</placeName> and the emperor was personally leading a campaign against desert peoples in the area beyond <placeName type="ancient">Tripolitania</placeName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">It would appear that an embassy of the <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses</placeName> met the imperial trio while they were in North Africa and presented them with a petition.<note n="432"> It would be helpful for a future paper to review what we know about <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Severus’</persName>activities in North Africa in 202, whether and to what degree he toured the various provinces there, and how close he might have come to <placeName type="ancient">Tipasa</placeName>. This inscription may indicate that the imperial family, including the emperor, were present at <placeName type="ancient">Tipasa</placeName>. </note> They were seeking the restoration of borders and an (associated?) immunity from taxation that had originally been conferred on them by <persName>King Juba II,</persName> somehow linked to an oath sworn to (or by) the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName> himself.<note n="433"> This interpretation of the odd phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">coniuriationem divi Aug(usti)</foreign> in lines 8-9 relies upon an improved reading and explanatory analysis: Desanges 1994. </note> It is not clear whether a border dispute with a neighboring community led to the appearance before the emperor, or whether the <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses</placeName> just seized upon the emperor’s presence as an opportunity to seek a <foreign xml:lang="la"><seg type="T11">beneficium</seg></foreign>.</p>
<p rend="indent">The text does not explicitly record the reason why the borders needed restoring, but it is clear from the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">post</foreign> <foreign xml:lang="la">multis maximisque saeculis</foreign> that it had been a long time since they had been observed. The concomitant question of immunity may provide an additional clue. It is possible that the original <foreign xml:lang="la">territorium</foreign> of the <foreign xml:lang="la">castellum Thudedensium</foreign>, along with the original tax immunity, had been revoked or ignored by subsequent emperors, governors or imperial tax officials. A significant reduction in territory would have meant a corresponding reduction in taxable agricultural capacity. Combined with the revocation of immunity, the increase in tax burden on the community may have been substantial, thereby explaining the community’s interest in returning to the Augustan arrangement. That they still knew of the Augustan arrangement after “many very great ages” is in itself impressive.</p>
<p rend="indent">The grant of <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia</foreign> such as these is in keeping with <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Severus’</persName> behavior in North Africa during 202. He is known to have granted the <foreign xml:lang="la">ius italicum</foreign> to <placeName type="ancient">Lepcis</placeName>, <placeName type="ancient">Carthage</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Utica</placeName>.<note n="434"> s.v. Septimius Severus, Lucius, OCD<seg type="T19">3</seg> by A. Birley. </note> Of course, the inscription does not record the names of any parties (other communities, imperial or private estates?) that might have been diminished or might have incurred new local tax obligations as a consequence of the <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses’</placeName> good fortune.</p>
<p rend="indent">Given that the emperor was prepared to grant the request of the <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses</placeName>, how were the old borders to be identified for restoration? It is possible that <foreign xml:lang="la">termini</foreign> had been placed in <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus’</persName> day, but if the borders had been diminished by official action, these would probably have been removed. The <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses</placeName>had a solution for the problem. They were able to produce, either from their own records or from some imperial archive, a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio saeculi</foreign>, which I take to mean a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> “from the (former) age.” The <placeName type="ancient">Thudedenses</placeName> located a copy of an official survey description, of the type already discussed, delineating the borders granted them by Juba II! If this interpretation is correct and the <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> was genuine, it means that either the community or the imperial government had stored the document for as much as 200 years, and that someone was able to locate and produce that document from the archive after all that time.<note n="435"> Compare the antiquity of evidence consulted by Nigrinus (Instance <ref target="#INST16"><bibl><biblScope>39</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). </note></p>

<p rend="indent">In his rescript to the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini </placeName>– an indigenous community whose territory spanned the base of the <placeName type="modern">Cap Corse </placeName>peninsula on <placeName type="modern">Corsica</placeName> – <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> delegates resolution of their boundary dispute with long-established Roman colonists at <placeName type="ancient">Mariana </placeName>to the provincial governor.

<head>Dispute between the <placeName type="ancient">Falerienses</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Firmani</placeName> concerning <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign></head>
<p>Date(s): <date/></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">An inscription on bronze records a land dispute in the area of <placeName type="ancient">Falerio</placeName> (mod. Falerone in Italy). It can be dated to the reign of Domitian by imperial titulature and a consular date formula. The text preserves an imperial rescript to the <placeName type="ancient">Falerienses</placeName>, communicating Domitian’s verdict (<foreign xml:lang="la">cognita causa pronuntiavi quod suscriptum est</foreign>) concerning their dispute about subseciva with the people of nearby <placeName type="ancient">Firmum Picenum</placeName> (mod. Fermo).</p>
<p rend="indent">This document reveals an important difference in the emperor’s handling of boundary disputes as compared with other types of land disputes. It is particularly instructive to compare this rescript with the Vespasianic rescript issued to the Corsican <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini</placeName> in their boundary dispute with the Roman colony of <placeName type="ancient">Mariana</placeName> (mod. La Canonica).<note n="416"> Instance <ref target="#INST52"><bibl><biblScope>25</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> In Domitian’s case, the dispute involved not the location of borders, but the rights to <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign>, portions of land that had not been distributed individually to colonists during the centuriation and land distribution associated with the foundation of the colony. The <placeName type="ancient">Firmani </placeName>challenged the right of citizens of <placeName type="ancient">Falerio</placeName> to occupy and farm these <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign>, a right the <placeName type="ancient">Falerienses </placeName>felt they maintained by virtue of a grant from their colony’s founder, the emperor Augustus. Lands that had been distributed to individual colonists during the colonial foundation would have been transferred by formal title, and so were susceptible to documentary proof. The assignment of these plots would have been recorded on the bronze <foreign xml:lang="la">forma </foreign>prepared by the surveyors. If subsequently transferred to another owner, there should have been written documentation of that transfer. But under Roman law, ownership of land could be procured without title by occupying land not susceptible to title for a period of time (<foreign xml:lang="la">possessio </foreign>by <foreign xml:lang="la">usucapio</foreign>). No formal documentation would be available in such circumstances.  <note n="417"> <foreign xml:lang="la">Subseciva</foreign>, colonial foundation and associated records: Moatti 1993, 35-36, 54-55, 119-122 and 135, Campbell 1996, 86-98. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">Domitian was not impressed with the argument of the <placeName type="ancient">Firmani</placeName>. He gives two reasons for ruling in favor of the Falerienses as <foreign xml:lang="la">possessores</foreign>. The first reason arises from the law of <foreign xml:lang="la">possessio </foreign>itself. Domitian ruled that the <foreign xml:lang="la">possessores</foreign> had been occupying and using the land far longer than the minimum time necessary to obtain ownership rights according to the law. His verdict expresses irritation that the <placeName type="ancient">Firmani</placeName> even tried to raise the issue, given the provisions of the law and the amount of time the <placeName type="ancient">Falerieneses</placeName> had been on the land.</p>
<p rend="indent">Domitian’s expressed irritation aside, it is not entirely surprising that a community might, at this period, seize upon the question of <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva </foreign>as an opportunity to forward a rivalry or gain an advantage over a neighboring community. There is ample documentation for a project of Vespasian that was intended to increase imperial revenue by reasserting the long-neglected rights of the Roman people to perpetual ownership of <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign> that had not been granted to colonists or to the pre-colonial communities from whom the land had been confiscated originally.<note n="418"> Campbell 2000, 39.21, 41.35-42, 89.46-91, 99.26-27, and 131.20-21. I am grateful to M. Johnson for the collation of these citations from the <foreign xml:lang="la">corpus agrimensorum</foreign>. It would be a mistake to connect this project with contemporaneous epigraphic sources addressed inthis dissertation, including: the restoration of sacred land to the temple of Diana Tifatina in <placeName type="ancient">Campania</placeName> (Instance <ref target="#INST103"><bibl><biblScope>67</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), the restoration of public lands to <placeName type="ancient">Pompeii</placeName>(Instance <ref target="#INST23"><bibl><biblScope>65</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), the restoration of Roman public lands in <placeName type="ancient">Cyrenaica</placeName>(Instance <ref target="#INST183"><bibl><biblScope>62</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), and the restoration of the public lands of <placeName type="ancient">Canusium</placeName>(Instance <ref target="#INST59"><bibl><biblScope>66</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). In none of these cases is <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign>mentioned, and in only one case (<placeName type="ancient">Cyrenaica</placeName>) are the lands in question attributed to the <foreign xml:lang="la">populus Romanus</foreign>. The other cases involved land that either belonged traditionally to the communities in question (a Roman confirmation thereof assumed), or that had been granted by the Romans to those communities already. In these situations, the emperor was assisting the communities in regaining for themselves their own public lands and the revenue associated with them. </note> This arrangement would have required the current occupiers of the land to vacate it, or purchase for its continued use a perpetual lease from the state. Domitian – confronted by widespread opposition – is said to have ultimately dropped the project and granted the land in question to its occupiers.</p>
<p rend="indent">Domitian’s second reason was based on interpretation of a document, presumably presented by the <foreign xml:lang="la">possessores</foreign>. It was a letter of Augustus to the veterans of the fourth legion (<foreign xml:lang="la">Quartani</foreign>),<note n="419"> Both the OLD and Lewis and Short recognize this usage. Tac. Hist. 4.37 provides a fine example of the usage: <foreign xml:lang="la">Dein mutati in paenitentiam primani quartanique et duoetvicensimani Voculam sequuntur ...</foreign> (Then, repenting their action, the men of the First, Fourth and Twenty-second legions followed Vocula). </note> in which he admonished them to gather up and sell the <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign>. Domitian does not need this piece of evidence in order to rule in favor of the Falerienses; the argument from the law is sufficient. But he brings it in anyway, in part to underline his displeasure with the <placeName type="ancient">Firmani</placeName>, observing that he had no doubt that the veterans observed so salutary an admonition.</p>
<p rend="indent">Why does Domitian feel comfortable making this ruling himself, when Vespasian had delegated final authority to the provincial governor in the case of the Corsican dispute? Though he lacks a governor to depend on for cases in Italy, he could easily have followed Claudius’ example and assigned an <foreign xml:lang="la">amicus </foreign>to handle the case. Apart from considerations of each emperor’s individual style, the two cases revolve around different legal issues. In the case of the <placeName type="ancient">Firmani</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Falerienses</placeName>, the location and delineation of the <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign> do not appear to have been in dispute. Everyone involved presumably knew and accepted the boundaries that defined the <foreign xml:lang="la">subseciva</foreign>. The use of the term implies a centuriated area, which ought to have been well-marked and documented. The dispute was over who had the right of ownership and use. The Corsican dispute, on the other hand, involved the actual or purported location of borders themselves. Resolution of the dispute would have involved confirming that boundary markers dividing the two cities’ territories were in the correct place, and restoring them if they were not. On Corsica, the governor, aided by the surveyor Vespasian had sent, would have had to identify and validate relevant documentation (maps, <foreign xml:lang="la">determinationes</foreign>, extant boundary markers) in order to properly redemarcate the boundaries. Boundary disputes required extensive intervention on site. Other types of land disputes did not.<note n="420"> See further discussion at Instance <ref target="#INST99"><bibl><biblScope>24</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note></p>

<p rend="indent">A. Aichinger lists this case as an example of a governor handling a boundary dispute “under the significant influence of an emperor,” but she does not analyze the matter in any detail.<note n="311"> Aichinger 1982, 201. </note> It does at first seem to abrogate the general rule that governors handled boundary disputes themselves so long as all parties involved fell under their own provincial jurisdiction. But careful attention to the wording of the document makes the matter clearer. <persName>Augurinus</persName> says that the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> had written to him. He does not represent himself as acting “on the orders of” vel sim. There are two possible explanations for what appears here to be imperial delegation: either the boundary dispute was associated in some way with other issues that required an imperial decision, or some aspect of the case led <persName>Augurinus</persName> to consult the emperor on the appropriate procedure to follow.</p>
<p rend="indent">We do have at least one other example where a provincial community sent an embassy to the emperor with a number of concerns, including a boundary dispute.<note n="312"> Instance <ref target="#INST52"><bibl><biblScope>25</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian’s</persName> response to a petition of the <placeName type="ancient">Vanacini</placeName>carefully addresses each of their concerns, including the confirmation of an unspecified beneficium, something the governor could not have done. He explicitly says that he has written to their provincial governor that he should resolve the boundary dispute after consulting a surveyor whom the emperor was sending. In this letter, <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> uses language similar to that employed by <persName>Augurinus</persName> here. It seems particularly likely in <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian’s</persName> case that concerns normally handled by provincial governors will have gone directly to the emperor, given his travels in the provinces.<note n="313"> Compare Instance <ref target="#INST66"><bibl><biblScope>43</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">A second possibility is consultation of the emperor by the governor.<note n="314"> Instance <ref target="#INST69"><bibl><biblScope>68</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> We have an example of this type as well, and it too dates to the reign of Hadrian. The incomplete dossier from <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName> that addresses the disputes surrounding the sacred land of Zeus preserves a letter of Hadrian that was clearly prompted by a query from the governor on a complicated aspect of the affair. It is not unreasonable to suppose that Augurinus similarly found it necessary to consult the emperor.</p>

<p type="treDisputeStatement">This three-party marker, found near mod. <placeName type="modern">Villanueva de Córdoba</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Spain</placeName> attests to a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> that occurred before or during the reign of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>. The dispute was adjudicated by one <persName>Iulius Proculus</persName>, styled <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> in the inscription.

<p rend="indent">The identity of <persName>Iulius Proculus </persName>is problematic and has been much debated. Most recently, Von Stylow has argued cogently that he was <persName>C.

Presumably, one or more of the parties reopened the case in some way, and the affair was brought to the emperor’s attention.

<p type="treDisputeStatement">A single boundary marker, found at <placeName type="modern">Acharnes</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Crete,</placeName> attests to a dispute about land ownership between a citizen of the Roman colony of <placeName type="ancient">Capua</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Italy</placeName>, which controlled land in central <placeName type="modern">Crete,</placeName> and a citizen of the Roman colony at <placeName type="ancient">Cnossus</placeName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">In a seminal 1976 article, K. Rigsby reconstructed the outlines of civic territories in central <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName> and the changes produced by Roman engagement with the island.<note n="281"> Rigsby 1976. </note> His argument hinges on this inscription when taken together with several others.<note n="282"> Rigsby 1976, <seg type="term">passim</seg>. Relevant inscriptions of the Roman era include our Instance <ref target="#INST103"><bibl><biblScope>67</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> Both colonies were separate Roman foundations, <placeName type="ancient">Cnossus</placeName> by <persName>Caesar</persName> and <placeName type="ancient">Capua</placeName> by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName>. During this same period, <placeName type="ancient">Capua</placeName> was granted significant territory in <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName> in compensation for Campanian land redistributed to <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus’</persName> veterans, although this land on Crete was probably not occupied to any great degree by Capuans themselves. The Capuan <foreign xml:lang="la">praefectura</foreign>on <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName> reportedly generated an annual income of 1,200,000 sesterces, probably derived from rents paid by the indigenous population from whom the land had been taken.<note n="283"> The relevant ancient sources are Appian, BCiv. 4.3, Cass. Dio 49.14.5, Strabo 10.478 and Vell. Pat. 2.81.1-2. The discussion at Rigsby 1976, 322-324 and 327-329 is essential. More recently, Baldwin Bowsky 1987 has speculated that the Capuan grant in <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName> was part of a sweeping Augustan reorganization of landholding in the area, overseen by the proconsul <persName>M. Nonius Balbus</persName> in ca. 36-27 BC. </note> By the end of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus’</persName> reign, the central valley of <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName> from north to south was wholly controlled by Roman citizen communities (<placeName type="ancient">Colonia Cnossus</placeName>, <placeName type="ancient">Colonia Capua </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Gortyn</placeName>).</p>
<p rend="indent">The present inscription reveals an otherwise unknown individual of the late first century AD, <persName>Plotius Plebeius</persName>, engaged in a dispute with the <placeName type="ancient">Colonia Capua </placeName>that ultimately resulted in the placement of boundary markers. Members of <persName>Plebeius’</persName> family are known to have been prominent citizens of the Roman colony at <placeName type="ancient">Cnossus</placeName>, so the land in question must either have been in Cnossan territory abutting the Capuan <foreign xml:lang="la">praefectura</foreign>, or was even surrounded by Capuan holdings but – <persName>Plebeius</persName>would have argued – exempted by the original Augustan apportionment.</p>
<p rend="indent">The validity of the boundary markers is explicitly reinforced by three factors: a verdict (<foreign xml:lang="la">sententia</foreign>) of the recently deceased emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Titus</persName>, a civic decree (<foreign xml:lang="la">decretum</foreign>) of <placeName type="ancient">Colonia Capua</placeName>, and the agreement of both parties (<foreign xml:lang="la">[ex c]onventione u[tri]usq(ue) [parti]s</foreign>). A. Aichinger has convincingly demonstrated why such a case would have involved the emperor personally: the two parties fell under separate jurisdictions (<persName>Plebeius</persName>, via <placeName type="ancient">Cnossus</placeName>, under the proconsul of <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName>, <placeName type="ancient">Capua</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Italy</placeName> directly under the emperor).<note n="284"> Aichinger 1982 passim, especially p. 195.

Baldwin Bowsky 1987, 220 credulously repeats this misconception. </note> What is surprising, on the model of our other evidence, is the way in which Titus’ involvement is characterized as a verdict (i.e., a judicial decision), with the corresponding diminution of his delegate’s role to that of a mere implementer. Given the requirement in boundary disputes for the final verdict to be rendered on site in the presence of the opposing parties, we would have to conclude either that <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Titus</persName> judged the case in person on <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName> (inconceivable not least given the posthumous date of the inscription), or that this was not in the main a boundary dispute.</p>
<p rend="indent">We would have expected the emperor to appoint a <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> to decide such a case. If, however, the dispute was primarily one about ownership of a contested site, the question before <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Titus</persName>would have been the relative validity of the rival claims to ownership. Such a decision could easily have taken place wherever the emperor was, provided that convincing documentation and arguments could be brought before him, and the parties could agree on the location and extent of the property in question. The Capuan decree and the parties’ agreement may reflect such a state of affairs, or they may be indicative of subsequent arrangements related to implementation of the emperor’s verdict. If indeed the location and extent of the property in question had been agreed by the parties, then the emperor’s procurator need not have been granted judiciary authority, so long as all parties could have confidence that he would see to an accurate demarcation.<note n="285"> We do not know the precise regular duties of this particular procurator, who is otherwise unattested. PIR<seg type="T19">2</seg> M516 and Aichinger 1982, 195. </note> The primary purpose of the termination, then, was to memorialize the emperor’s decision, indicating a boundary that marked a transition in ownership.</p>

<p type="treDisputeStatement">Sometime between AD 23 and 37, <persName>Lucius Volusius Saturninus</persName>, the governor of <placeName type="ancient">Dalmatia</placeName>, delivered a verdict (<foreign xml:lang="la">sententia</foreign>) in a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> between the communities of <placeName type="ancient">Nerate</placeName> (an unlocated site probably near <placeName type="ancient">Salona</placeName>, mod. <placeName type="modern">Solin</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Croatia</placeName>) and <placeName type="ancient">Oneum</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Omiš</placeName>).</p>

<head>Disputes Attested on an ‘Archive Wall’ from <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName></head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, no. 71</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>c. AD 125 - 161</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">This dossier provides evidence for, among other matters, a very complex and long-running <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> between <placeName type="ancient">Coroneia</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName>, as well as two other disputes involving <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>that may have touched on boundaries too.</p>
<p rend="indent">Sometime after AD 161 a significant collection of imperial letters addressing civic affairs of <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName> was inscribed on a wall whose original context and function are now lost to us. Subsequently, this ‘archive wall’ was disassembled, and the blocks reused in the construction of churches and other structures in the area of ancient <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>. A number of the surviving elements of the wall have slowly been published over the course of the 20th century, so that we now have substantial portions of at least ten letters from three emperors (<persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>: five, <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus Pius</persName>: four, and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Marcus Aurelius</persName>together with <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Lucius Verus</persName>: one), as well as four smaller fragments of other documents. The latest letter, that of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Marcus Aurelius</persName> and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Verus (Text </persName><persName type="emperor" rend="normal"><ref target="ddoc:452"><bibl><biblScope>43.10</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref></persName><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">, AD 161)</persName>, provides a <seg type="term">terminus post quem</seg> for the inscription of the wall and, as Fossey has pointed out, a possible explanation for the selection and inscription of the other letters.<note n="325"> This letter is of a standard type, confirming <placeName type="ancient">Coronea’s </placeName>rights of freedom and autonomy (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅσα</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">τῆς</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐλευθερίας</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτονομίας</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">δίκαια</foreign>) as they had been granted by prior emperors and confirmed by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus Pius</persName>. All commentators agree, on the basis of letter forms and layout, that the documents were inscribed together at the same time. Fossey’s opinion on this matter led him to place the latest document first in his presentation; it does begin one of the surviving blocks, none of which were found <seg type="term">in situ</seg>. If he is correct, the archive may have served to document and advertise various instances of imperial favor, granted over the years and confirmed once again for a new reign. In this regard, the dossier would bear some resemblance to the twin stelae from the territory of <placeName type="ancient">Histria</placeName>(Instance <ref target="#INST21"><bibl><biblScope>16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). If Oliver and Roesch are right, however, in independently placing that block last in the sequence, then it may be more difficult to argue that this letter governs the whole collection, for another letter of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus</persName>—too fragmentary to reveal its subject—follows this one. We would have expected a thematically diagnostic letter to come either first or last in such a dossier. </note> </p>
<p type="P22">The better-preserved portions of the archive can be divided into three topical groups:<note n="326"> Fossey and Oliver see these three subject groupings as complementary but distinct, whereas Boatwright takes the entire collection as arising from a common origin. Specifically, she argues that all the disputes attested in the dossier arose over newly useful land reclaimed from the lake’s margins through <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>’s engineering works, with the result that “the imperial project seems to have incited smoldering local rivalries, inadvertently causing greater outside interference in the region rather than a more stable autonomy” (Boatwright 2000, 87 and 115-116). Fossey too acknowledges a probable link between the Hadrianic project documented in Text <ref target="ddoc:444"><bibl><biblScope>43.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, which involved the construction of “levees for the <placeName type="ancient">Kepheisos</placeName>, <placeName type="ancient">Herkynna</placeName> and the other rivers,” and the mysterious dispute at the <placeName type="ancient">Phalaros</placeName>, delegated to <persName>Aemilius Iuncus</persName> in Text <ref target="ddoc:448"><bibl><biblScope>43.5</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. On the other hand, Fossey sees no connection between the <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName>-<placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName> dispute and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>’s drainage projects. He argues that the territory in dispute was “in the small plain of the upland village of <placeName type="modern">Koúkoura </placeName>where the territories of <placeName type="ancient">Koroneia</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName> meet high on <placeName type="modern">Mt. Helikon</placeName>.” It is indeed hard to believe that <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName>, lying as it did on relatively flat land at the southern foot of <placeName type="modern">Mt. Helikon</placeName>, should have been contending with <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>, its counterpart to the north of the mountain range, for pasture rights to land on the littoral of the <placeName type="ancient">Copais Lacus</placeName>, probably lying further to the north and west of <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>. Burton 2000, 211 no. 71 has hopelessly confused this dossier, citing only a portion of it and describing it incorrectly as “a dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Orchomenos</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName> over territory and rights of pasturage ...” In point of fact, <placeName type="ancient">Orchomenos</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName>were clearly embroiled in separate disputes, each against <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>, and are never represented in the dossier as having been in conflict with each other. </note></p>
<ul>

<p rend="indent">The sequence of four letters from <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus Pius</persName> regarding a protracted dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName> (Texts <ref target="ddoc:449"><bibl><biblScope>43.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:451"><bibl><biblScope>43.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) is particularly interesting to us here.

<p rend="indent">The first letter of the group in inscribed sequence (<ref target="ddoc:449"><bibl><biblScope>43.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) seems to have been <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Pius</persName>’ last letter on the matter. It is marked ‘L’ in Figure 2, which presents the documentation for this dispute in chronological order, rather than in the order the documents were inscribed. This letter dates to the 18<seg type="T19">th</seg> year of his tribunician power (AD 154/5), and was provoked by an embassy from <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName> which brought to him a civic decree (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T31">ψήφισμα</seg></foreign><seg type="T31">), no longer extant (‘K’).

<p rend="indent">We would expect to see next in the archive the text of whatever had been attached to <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus</persName>’ letter, including the “copies of what [he] had dispatched to the <placeName type="ancient">Thisbeis</placeName>.” There are two letters inscribed as if attachments to the original letter: a letter of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> to <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName> (under a heading styling him ‘god’ and lacking his full introduction and imperial titulature, Text <ref target="ddoc:450"><bibl><biblScope>43.7</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>= ‘C’), and a seemingly unrelated letter of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus</persName>, dating to AD 140 (Text <ref target="ddoc:454"><bibl><biblScope>43.8</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).<note n="333"> In this letter <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus</persName>acknowledges a <placeName type="modern">Coronean</placeName> embassy that had come to congratulate him on his accession and adoption of the future emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Marcus Aurelius</persName>.

<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>’s letter (‘C’) is short and to the point, chastising the <placeName type="ancient">Thisbeis</placeName> for failing to obey his verdict and invading the territory of the <placeName type="ancient">Koroneioi</placeName>. It is clearly not the original decision (‘A’) mentioned by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus</persName> in the initial letter of the dossier (‘L’). Rather, <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> is addressing complaints from the <placeName type="modern">Coroneans</placeName> (‘B’) that the <placeName type="modern">Thisbeans</placeName> had violated the terms of that decision. In other words, Hadrian’s original decision, delegating the resolution of the case, is now lost to us, but it is clear from the surviving texts that that decision was not properly implemented or observed, and so the matter was brought to his attention again. Both the original judgment, and now the assessment of penalties for its abrogation, were delegated to the same man mentioned in <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Antoninus</persName>’ later letter: <persName>Mestrios Aristonymos</persName> (‘A’ and ‘D’).</p>
<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal"><seg type="T31">Antoninus</seg></persName><seg type="T12">’ earliest relevant letter (inscribed fourth = ‘G’) makes it clear that the dispute continued more than 18 years after </seg><persName type="emperor" rend="normal"><seg type="T31">Hadrian</seg></persName><seg type="T12">’s death. Either </seg><persName><seg type="T31">Aristonymos</seg></persName><seg type="T12"> had been unable to completely resolve the matter, despite the second commission from </seg><persName type="emperor" rend="normal"><seg type="T31">Hadrian</seg></persName><seg type="T12">, and it had taken almost two decades for the parties to bring the matter before </seg><persName type="emperor" rend="normal"><seg type="T31">Antoninus</seg></persName><seg type="T12">, or fresh trouble related to the old dispute had broken out.

<p rend="indent"><seg type="T31">This long-running affair demonstrates a seemingly habitual application of the petition-response-delegation procedure at the highest levels to a boundary dispute, with little regard for its effectiveness.

<head>Dispute Over Lands Attributed to Zeus the Founder at <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName></head>
<p>Date(s): <date/></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">Three fragmentary boundary markers found in the vicinity of <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">Çavdarhisar</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Turkey</placeName>) record the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian’s</persName>restoration (<foreign xml:lang="la">imperator ... restituit</foreign>) of the “boundaries given to Zeus the Founder and the <foreign xml:lang="la">civitas</foreign> of the <placeName type="ancient">Aezaniti</placeName> by Attalus and Prousias the kings” (<foreign xml:lang="la">fines Iovi conditori et civitati Aezanitorum datos ab Attalo et Prusia regibus</foreign>). We are lucky in this case to be able to discover the circumstances of this restoration through a surviving dossier of related letters, inscribed on the walls of the temple of Zeus in <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName>. The restoration of the boundaries, which can be dated to AD 129, appears to have been the concluding act of a judicial saga that began at least as early as AD 119 and engaged two proconsuls of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName> and the emperor himself. Its consequence – the reestablishment of a steady revenue stream for the city, which seems to have administered the temple’s funds – may have facilitated the promotion of Zeus’ birth cult at <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName> and helped to finance the massive building projects of the Hadrianic and Antonine periods.<note n="412"> MAMA 9, xxxiii-xxxiv. The governor’s letter (Text 1.1 explicitly indicates that resolution of the dispute will permit “the city to enjoy the revenues due to it” (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἵνα μὴ πάλιν τινὲς ἀ[μφισβητοῦντες περὶ τοῦ τέλους τοῦ] Βράδειον ἀπολαῦσαι τὴν πόλιν τῆς [προσηκούσης προσόδου παραίτιοι] γένωνται</foreign>). </note> The dispute stemmed from land distributions made in the early second century BC that had dropped out of practice and certain knowledge in the intervening centuries, but whose financial consequences (i.e., lease payments to the temple) had recently been revived by unknown parties. This case illustrates very well the manner in which a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> could arise from another type of land dispute. It also illustrates the manner in which the course of a case, the availability of evidence and the strategies adopted by the litigants, could cause a single dispute to exhibit many of the characteristics of the different case classifications recognized by the <foreign xml:lang="la">agrimensores</foreign>.</p>

The quality and accessibility of this presentation – combined with the time limitations associated with production of the dissertation – have led me to omit reproducing the texts and translations here. MAMA does not provide a translation of the boundary markers, so I have proceeded with a full presentation of these. Relevant editions with commentary have also been published subsequent to MAMA 9: Mixed Language Inscriptions 166a-b and Bringmann 1995, 286-291.253. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">This dispute centered on land near <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi </placeName>that had originally been donated to the temple of Zeus there by two Hellenistic kings, probably <persName>Attalus I</persName> and <persName>Prusias I</persName>. This land, divided into parcels called <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleroi</seg>, seems to have been assigned originally to military or paramilitary colonists, with the result that the fees paid for leases (<foreign xml:lang="la">vectigal</foreign>) were devoted to the god. By <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian’s</persName> time, the payment of these fees was evidently long out of practice. Further, the pattern of landholding in the area had changed significantly, so that the original size of the <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleroi</seg> could not be determined, and so that some landowners could argue that the land they held did not fall within the boundaries of the original allotment (i.e., they were not temple lands at all). These issues apparently arose because of an attempt (its origins obscure) to reinstate the <foreign xml:lang="la">vectigal</foreign>associated with the original <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleroi</seg>. It seems unlikely that the Romans in any way initiated this matter; rather, it most likely arose from competition between local elites who, unable to resolve the affair, brought it to the provincial governor for adjudication.</p>
<p rend="indent">The first documented Roman engagement with the dispute occurred during the term of <persName>C. Trebonius Proculus Mettius Modestus </persName>(proconsul of Asia, AD 119-120). The details of the case are not extant, but he seems to have issued a verdict as to the rate at which the <foreign xml:lang="la">vectigal</foreign> was to be calculated. <persName>Modestus’</persName> verdict did not resolve the matter, which next engaged <persName>T. Avidius Quietus </persName>(proconsul of Asia, AD 124-125). The complaint brought before <persName>Quietus </persName>seems to have centered on two issues of implementation. First, it seems that the size of the original <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleroi</seg>, on which the amounts of the <foreign xml:lang="la">vectigal </foreign>were to be calculated, could not be agreed. Secondly, there was disagreement over the date to which retrospective payments should be calculated.</p>
<p rend="indent">It is clear that there was no intent to redistribute land or redemarcate individual <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleroi</seg>. The idea was to determine the amount of area per original <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleros</seg>, which could then be divided into the amount of <foreign xml:lang="la">vectigal </foreign>fixed by Modestus, thereby producing a rate that could be applied to the existing landholdings. In the end, <persName>Quietus </persName>was unable to find convincing evidence for the original size of the <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleroi</seg>. An imposed settlement to this issue was needed, and so he recommended to the emperor that the average size of <seg type="treGreekTransliterated">kleroi </seg>in neighboring communities be used for the calculations needed at <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName>. Hadrian agreed, and a procurator was commissioned to conduct the investigation in the neighboring communities. Surveyors were deployed by the procurator to gather the information.</p>
<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian’s</persName> reply to <persName>Quietus</persName>, which in tone and scope compares favorably with the replies of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName>preserved in <persName>Pliny’s</persName>correspondence from <placeName type="ancient">Bithynia</placeName>, also addressed the issue of retrospective payment.<note n="414"> It should be noted here that consultation of the emperor seems to have occurred on the governor’s initiative. Having arrived at a stage in the dispute where precedents and locally available evidence had failed, <persName>Quietus </persName>was conscious that new law touching on an aspect of the case needed to be made: a specific solution to the problem of inadequate evidence needed to be imposed. He had an idea of how that should be accomplished, but sought the emperor’s guidance and confirmation. This procedure compares favorably, and even illuminates, <persName>Pliny’s</persName> correspondence with <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName>. It also suggests that, in other boundary disputes adjudicated by governors where the emperor’s involvement or authority is cryptically invoked, a similar set of conditions obtained. </note> If there was no question as to the identification of property as part of the temple lands, then payment was to be calculated from the date of <persName>Modestus’</persName> earlier ruling. If there were some question, then calculation was to begin from the date of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian’s</persName> letter, even if subsequent legal action related to that identification were to take more time.</p>
<p rend="indent">This last provision proved to be prescient (or the issue was already explicit), for the three boundary markers demonstrate that a subsequent survey and demarcation were needed in AD 129. This survey was evidently aimed at recovering the boundaries of the area that the kings had originally donated to the temple, and seems to have taken a written demarcation made by <persName>Prusias</persName> as its basis. On the basis of this demarcation, current landholdings could then be assessed to see if they fell within the area subject to the reinstated <foreign xml:lang="la">vectigal</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="indent">It is possible that the disputes over sacred land at <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName> were provoked by an imperial building project. The well-preserved temple of Zeus was constructed at this period. Just as Augustus (and possibly later emperors) restored pre-existing sacred land of Artemis at Ephesus in order to fund major building projects there, Hadrian may have had a similar plan in mind.</p>

<p type="treDisputeStatement">A recurring dispute over territorial control (<foreign xml:lang="la">controversia de iure territorii</foreign>) that eventually required the restoration of boundaries, therefore probably also a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi>.</p>
<p rend="indent">According to the testimony of <persName>Tacitus</persName>, the year AD 25 saw the appearance in <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName> of delegations from <placeName type="ancient">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Messene</placeName>, each seeking control of the extra-urban sanctuary of Artemis Limnatis, located on the west slope of the <placeName type="ancient">Taygetos</placeName> mountains along the drainage of the <placeName type="ancient">Choireios</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Sandava</placeName>) river in <placeName type="modern">Greece</placeName>. (Text <ref target="ddoc:196"><bibl><biblScope>10.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). It emerges from the terse Tacitean précis of the hearing that control of the sanctuary – and more broadly the <placeName type="ancient">ager Denthaliatis</placeName> that contained it – had been an issue between the two cities since at least the denouement of <persName>Philip’s</persName> victory at <placeName type="ancient">Chaeronea</placeName> in 338 BC. <persName>Philip</persName> had removed the sanctuary from <placeName type="modern">Spartan</placeName>control and given it to <placeName type="ancient">Messene</placeName>.<note n="240"> <seg type="T33">Ager 1989 no. 2 = Piccirilli 1973 no. 61.</seg> </note> A subsequent verdict of a “King Antigonos” (presumably <persName>Antigonos III Doson</persName>, c. 222 BC) confirmed <placeName type="modern">Messenian</placeName>control,<note n="241"> <seg type="T33">Ager 1989 no. 50.</seg> </note> as did a verdict of <persName>Lucius Mummius</persName>, apparently in the aftermath of the revolt of the Achaean Confederacy and the sack of <placeName type="modern">Corinth</placeName> (146 BC).<note n="242"> <seg type="T33">Ager 1989 no. 150.</seg> </note> In both of these cases, it must have been the <placeName type="modern">Spartans</placeName> who raised the issue with the new rulers.<note n="243"> <seg type="T33">Ager 1989, 141.</seg> </note> <persName>Mummius’</persName> arrangements were confirmed c. 138 BC in a ruling by a panel of judges in an arbitration requested by the <placeName type="modern">Spartans</placeName> and delegated by the Roman Senate to the city of <placeName type="ancient">Miletos</placeName>.<note n="244"> <seg type="T33">Ager 1989 no. 159. </seg>This case is documented not only by Tacitus’ brief mention, but by substantial epigraphic evidence: a lengthy dossier of three texts inscribed on the base of the Nike of Paionios at the sanctuary of Zeus at <placeName type="ancient">Olympia</placeName>. See Ager for text and full references. </note> The <placeName type="modern">Spartan</placeName> envoys of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius’ </persName>day also cited an undated verdict of <persName>Julius Caesar</persName> and <persName>Marcus Antonius</persName>, which returned the sanctuary to them. According to the <placeName type="modern">Messenian</placeName> presentation, this verdict was overturned by a governor of <placeName type="ancient">Achaia</placeName> under <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName> or <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName>, one <persName>Atidius Geminus</persName> (otherwise unknown to us).</p>
<p rend="indent">It is unclear from <persName>Tacitus’</persName> prose whether this case was heard before the emperor or before the Senate. The entire sequence is presented in almost bullet form, entirely in indirect discourse.<note n="245"> Talbert 1984, 418 assumes the embassies appeared before the Senate. Ager 1989, 141 assumes a hearing before <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName>. At this point in the <foreign rend="italic">Annales</foreign>, <persName>Tacitus</persName> has recently introduced the idea that <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName> had begun, at this period, to avoid attending meetings of the Senate (Tac. Ann. 4.42). Immediately after the summary of the dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Messene</placeName>, <persName>Tacitus</persName>relates the outcome of a request from <placeName type="ancient">Segesta</placeName> to restore a temple, an embassy explicitly answered in the affirmative by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName>. These two observations would tend to lend support to Ager’s position. On the other hand, the contest between <placeName type="ancient">Sparta</placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Messene</placeName>had a long pedigree, one in which the Roman Senate had been directly involved in the past. Further, it seems surprising that <persName>Tacitus</persName> would have missed the opportunity to emphasize this incident as another example of the emperor’s growing estrangement from (and usurpation of the traditional role of) the Senate, a narrative development that is clearly part of the author’s agenda in the latter chapters of this book of the <seg type="treTitle">Annals</seg>. That the incident is related in such obscure language, without a clear attribution of context, is perhaps indicative. If this case was heard by the Senate, with or without the involvement of the emperor, to say so explicitly would undermine the carefully crafted character progression that will culminate in <persName>Tiberius’</persName>withdrawal to <placeName type="modern">Capri</placeName> and <persName>Sejanus’</persName> supposed conspiracy. The fact that Tacitus evidently had access to copies or summaries of each side’s presentation would seem to confirm Talbert’s view that the hearing occurred before the Senate. It seems much less likely that Tacitus could have obtained such records had <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName> handled the case by <foreign xml:lang="la">cognitio</foreign>. The Senate seems to have been involved in the restoration and demarcation of public lands of <placeName type="ancient">Gortyn</placeName> in AD 64 or 65, but the details are obscure (See Instance <ref target="#INST94"><bibl><biblScope>64</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). </note> </p>
<p rend="indent">Nothing in the presentation of <persName>Tacitus</persName>, nor in the record of earlier cases, would lead us to classify this incident as a boundary dispute; however, a fragmentary inscription from the area of <placeName type="ancient">Messene</placeName> preserves a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> made in AD 78 (Text <ref target="ddoc:278"><bibl><biblScope>10.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). This Greek document, prepared by a surveyor who was a freedman of the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName>, was related to a restoration of boundaries. The beginning of the document – and the beginning portion of each of the surviving lines – is lost, but the <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign>has the boundary ending at “the sanctuary, named for Artemis Limnatis, which is above the torrent called <placeName type="ancient">Choireios</placeName>.”<note n="246"> The <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> lists boundary markers numbered 23-48, indicating that perhaps more than half the inscription has been entirely lost. </note> Although it is unclear under whose authority this surveyor restored the boundaries, the incident must be related in some way to the long history of the dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Messene</placeName> over the sanctuary and the <placeName type="ancient">ager Denthaliatis</placeName>. It may have been that the <placeName type="modern">Spartans’</placeName> next gambit was to challenge the validity of the boundaries the <placeName type="modern">Messenians</placeName> claimed for the area.<note n="247"> To assume, as Doukellis 1995, 222 does, that there is a causal link between the Vespasianic demarcation and the Tiberian decision is irresponsible supposition. The Tacitean presentation makes it clear that the question in AD 25 was one of control of the sanctuary – what the agrimensores would term a dispute about territorial jurisdiction = <foreign xml:lang="la">de iure territorii controversia </foreign>(Campbell 2000, 7.7-26) – not its boundaries. A disagreement over the exact path of the boundaries (if a disagreement was indeed the cause for the demarcation) surely represents a new stratagem on the part of one of the parties and, from the Roman point of view at a remove of several decades, a different legal matter. Doukellis 1995, 224 makes the further error of asserting “<seg type="treForeign"><seg type="T35">Par contre le litige territorial entre Spartiates et Messéniens ... a été finalement résolu par l’Empereur, en nommant le géomètre Flavius Monomitus pour répondre à l’appel des plaignants.</seg></seg>” There is no direct evidence that this matter involved the emperor at all. We may hypothesize (on the comparative basis of Instance <ref target="#INST39"><bibl><biblScope>85</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, <ref target="#INST52"><bibl><biblScope>25</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="#INST55"><bibl><biblScope>38</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) that a freedman surveyor of the emperor may have been assigned by the emperor, either to implement an imperial decision or (more likely) to assist a governor or appointed <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> in investigating and completing a case. There is one case in which a governor consults a surveyor with no mention of imperial involvement (Instance <ref target="#INST77"><bibl><biblScope>76</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), but, unlike the other instances just cited, that surveyor is neither a slave, freedman nor <foreign xml:lang="la">evocatus</foreign> of the emperor. We must be careful not to make too much of patchy information that can be salvaged from a fragmentary inscription.  </note> If so, we may hypothesize that the surveyor himself had been appointed as <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> by the emperor or provincial governor, or that he was assisting the governor or an appointed <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign>.<note n="248"> Burton 2000, 211 sub no. 66. </note> This inscription would then represent only part of the legal dossier resulting from it; there would have been a verdict as well, now lost to us.</p>
<p rend="indent">It is worth noting that this is the only <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> we have that is issued by the surveyor, not by the presiding official in the case. This observation introduces another possible explanation for the nature and responsibility of the affair. This surveyor may have been appointed (by the governor or the emperor) as the <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> himself, or may have been chosen by the parties in question as an <foreign xml:lang="la">arbiter ex compromisso</foreign> without engaging the legal/administrative apparatus at all. There are no clearly documented cases of either practice, but, given certain circumstances, either is conceivable.<note n="249"> See Campbell 2000, 476 for a discussion of the possibilities and limitations, with literature. Campbell does not mention this case in his discussion. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">The intrinsic interest of this inscription is heightened by the survival of a number of boundary markers from the area that seem to employ the same scheme of inscription as those described in the <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign>.<note n="250"> IG 5.1.1371a-c and 1372a-b. Chrimes 1949, 61-67 provides a reconstructed overview and discussion of the boundary’s path. </note></p>

<p rend="indent"><seg type="T31">The epigraphic component of our evidence for this dispute consists of two boundary marker texts and a badly damaged honorific inscription.

<p rend="indent"><seg type="T31">Just over a meter to the northeast of the cippus, and at an odd angle to it, stood a square stone platform, approximately five meters on a side, that supported a column approximately ten meters in height (six drums survive, three or four are thought to be missing). The capital of the column survives, and its upper surface is engraved with six holes consistent with two statues standing back-to-back (now lost), each figure of which must have held a scepter or similar object in its left hand.

<p rend="indent"><seg type="T31">This victorious restoration may have been celebrated by the people of </seg><placeName type="ancient"><seg type="T31">Palmyra</seg></placeName><seg type="T31"> through the erection of a large, honorific monument to the emperor.

The Antonine inscription that tells of Hadrian’s verdict dates to at least 12 years after the death of Hadrian.

In either case, the matter came to Antoninus’ attention somehow and was addressed yet again through the governor of Syria in AD 153.</seg></p>

<ul>

 <li>Between AD 117-138: markers erected on the authority of the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>, with no other officials mentioned. The markers separate public lands of <placeName type="ancient">Cirta</placeName> from allocated lands of <placeName type="ancient">Cirta</placeName>; i.e., lands that had been assigned to individual landowners within the territory of <placeName type="ancient">Cirta</placeName> (Texts <ref target="ddoc:84"><bibl><biblScope>81.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> through <ref target="ddoc:388"><bibl><biblScope>81.13</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).</li>

 <li>AD 138: markers erected on the authority of <persName>P. Cassius Secundus</persName>, an imperial legate of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>. The markers indicate public lands of <placeName type="ancient">Sigus</placeName>, and one marker explicitly separates those lands from allocated lands of the <placeName type="ancient">Cirtenses</placeName> (Texts <ref target="ddoc:86"><bibl><biblScope>81.23</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> through <ref target="ddoc:378"><bibl><biblScope>81.26</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> = Burton 2000 no. 57).

<p type="treDisputeStatement">Six boundary markers from various sites in Bulgaria attest to a demarcation between the provinces of <placeName type="ancient">Thracia</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Moesia Inferior</placeName>. These are the only markers in the published epigraphic record that explicitly marked a provincial boundary without making reference to any of the cities or communities in either province. The word provincia is not used. The ethnics corresponding to the provincial names are: <placeName type="ancient">Moesi</placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Thraces</placeName>. The markers were placed, on Hadrian’s authority, by an otherwise unknown individual named Antius Rufus, who is thought to have been acting as a special legate of the emperor. It is most unlikely that he was a governor of either of the provinces in question, since neither governor can have possessed a sufficient span of jurisdiction to affect both provinces. The context and motivation for this demarcation are completely obscure.</p>

It is unclear why the proconsul should have needed authorization to handle such a matter involving a city that fell within his provincial jurisdiction. Perhaps some of the parties occupying the lands in question asserted that they were not under his jurisdiction, therefore requiring special authorization. The involvement of the Senate is unusual for the imperial period, though standard during the Republic.

<p type="treDisputeStatement">This <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> (<foreign xml:lang="la">actum esse in re praesenti de controversia finium</foreign>) between a private landowner and the city of <placeName type="ancient">Histonium</placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">Vasto</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Italy</placeName>) was handled by binding arbitration in front of an arbiter selected by both parties to the dispute. It is one of only two documented cases of the use of binding arbitration in boundary disputes, and the only one to involve a civic entity.<note n="274"> The other dispute, which involved private parties on both sides, is documented on tablets from Herculaneum (see note <bibl><biblScope type="note">156</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl>). </note></p>
<p rend="indent">Although the inscription breaks off in the middle, enough survives for us to understand its content. It records the verdict (<foreign xml:lang="la">sentetia</foreign>, sic) of one <persName>Gaius Helvidius Priscus</persName>, acting as arbiter in a boundary dispute between an otherwise unknown individual named <persName>Tillius Sassus</persName> (represented by his procurator) and the <foreign xml:lang="la">municipium</foreign> <placeName type="ancient">Histoniensium</placeName>, represented by an advocate. At issue was the border separating two <foreign xml:lang="la">fundi</foreign>, one owned by each party. The surviving part of <persName>Priscus’</persName>verdict, which is given in the first person, concerns an important piece of evidence brought forward by the parties to the case: an old book that recorded a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> made during the resolution of an earlier dispute over the same property line. If scholarly conjectures going back to Dessau are correct in identifying <persName>Priscus</persName> with the famous Stoic philosopher and senatorial critic of Vespasian,<note n="275"> PIR<seg type="T19">2</seg> H59. </note> then his verdict must have been delivered sometime in the latter part of the first century. The earlier case had been decided by an individual named Quintus Coelius Gallus in AD 19 (according to the consular date formula), some 50 or more years earlier. He, evidently, had served as the arbiter or <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex </foreign>in the earlier case, and had produced a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> as part of his verdict.</p>
<p rend="indent">Of particular interest is <persName>Priscus’</persName> language in his prologue to the recitation and explication of the old <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign>.<note n="276"> On the basis of surviving evidence, this would appear to have been the universal form employed for rendering decisions in boundary disputes during the Roman empire, whether the case was resolved by an arbiter, an appointed <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign>, a governor, or a special legate of the emperor. </note> He describes the character of the original case and Gallus’ verdict using the same mixture of legal and boundary-related terms that we find in most of the extant Latin boundary-dispute evidence: <foreign xml:lang="la">actum esse in re praesenti de controversia finium, ita ut utrisque dominis tum fundorum praesentibus Gallus terminaret </foreign>(as the <foreign xml:lang="la">actio</foreign> in the case concerned a “dispute of boundaries,” so, with the then owners of both <foreign xml:lang="la">fundi</foreign> present, Gallus established the border). There is a clear linkage in <persName>Priscus’ </persName>phrase between the specific type of <foreign xml:lang="la">actio</foreign> (<foreign xml:lang="la">de controversia finium</foreign>), the presence of the owners of the property, and the process of <foreign xml:lang="la">terminatio</foreign> carried out by <persName>Gallus</persName> himself. Furthermore, <persName>Priscus’</persName> recitation of the old <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> emphasizes Gallus’ personal involvement in the placing of the boundaries and boundary markers (<foreign xml:lang="la">primum palum figeret ... palum fixum esse a Gallo ... derectam finem ab eodem Gallo</foreign>).</p>
<p rend="indent">It seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the resolution of an <foreign xml:lang="la">actio de controversia finium </foreign>required – even if resolved extra-judicially through an <foreign xml:lang="la">arbiter ex compromisso </foreign>– the presence of the judicially competent individual and the owners (or their legal representatives) on the disputed territory itself so that the path of the boundary and the character of the markers could be demonstrated to them. It is clear from much other evidence that the Romans willingly and easily transferred the terminology and procedures of the private law in this area to disputes in the provinces between every conceivable combination of litigants: private and civic, citizen and peregrine. If it was a requirement of the private law, as we have argued above, that the verdict in a boundary dispute be delivered on site in the presence of the parties to the case, then the extrapolation of this requirement to the provinces also may help to explain a number of factors. First of all, it will explain the frequent emphasis in verdicts on the presence of the governor or <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex </foreign>on the boundary in question. It also explains why the governor writing to <placeName type="ancient">Thasos </placeName>says that he had sent a soldier for the boundaries, and that when he arrived himself he would establish them. The official resolution of the matter had to wait for his arrival. The prevalence of delegation (both by governors and by emperors) is also explained: if someone actually had to go to the site, it would rarely be practical for a governor to do so, let alone an emperor.</p>

<p rend="indent">The surviving portion of the first side’s text picks up <seg type="term">in medias res</seg> with a <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> prefaced by references to a will (<foreign xml:lang="la">ex testa[men]to</foreign>) and to the verdict of the judge (<foreign xml:lang="la">[ex? sente]ntia iudicis</foreign>). The <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio</foreign> appears to have continued onto the second side, where it was followed, after a lacuna, by a narrative statement that includes a verb in the first person. In this portion of the text, the positions of both parties to the dispute are described. This would seem to indicate that this section constitutes a portion of the judge’s verdict. It emerges that the dispute concerned a piece of property that had been left in a will to an otherwise unknown individual named <persName>Livius Primus</persName>.<note n="361"> There seem to have been multiple heirs: <foreign xml:lang="la">in bonis caduci[s par]/tis Livi Primi., </foreign>i.e. he was <foreign xml:lang="la">heres ex parte.</foreign> </note> This property was claimed both by the city of <placeName type="ancient">Ostia</placeName> and by an otherwise unknown individual named <persName>Volussius Crocus</persName>. <placeName type="ancient">Ostia</placeName> seems to have argued that <persName>Primus’</persName> portion of the inheritance had been declared <foreign xml:lang="la">bona caduca</foreign>, i.e., an invalid inheritance and therefore the property ought to fall to the city.<note n="362"> Why the inheritance was invalid in this case is not indicated, although we may assume that <persName>Primus</persName> lacked the requisite number of children <seg type="term">vel sim</seg>. As Jacques points out in his edition and commentary, it is also surprising that a city should be able to claim <foreign xml:lang="la">bona caduca</foreign>. These are generally thought to have fallen to the <foreign xml:lang="la">aerarium</foreign>(if in Italy) or the <foreign xml:lang="la">fiscus</foreign> (if in the provinces). This situation would seem to indicate that <placeName type="ancient">Ostia</placeName> had acquired a right to retain such wealth when the case involved Ostian citizens, a right previously known only to have belonged to <placeName type="ancient">Nicea</placeName> (Plin. Ep. 10.84). We must therefore assume that <persName>Primus</persName> at least was a citizen of <placeName type="ancient">Ostia</placeName>. Jacques also notes that this is first occurrence of the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">bona caduca </foreign>in an epigraphic document. </note> Crocus claimed to have received the right to the property from the <placeName type="ancient">res publica</placeName> (of <placeName type="ancient">Ostia</placeName>) six and a half years before, and to have occupied it ever since.</p>
<p rend="indent">The <foreign xml:lang="la">determinatio </foreign>that precedes the extant portion of the verdict makes it clear that the case also involved disagreements over the boundaries of the property in question, and that <persName>Crocus</persName> owned property adjoining the disputed <foreign xml:lang="la">locus</foreign>. In this regard the case is broadly similar to a dispute between the city of <placeName type="ancient">Daulis</placeName> and a private individual.<note n="363"> Instance <ref target="#INST138"><bibl><biblScope>42</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> In that case, the problematic property had been purchased from some heirs and was located adjacent to properties owned by the city. It is not clear whether said civic land had been acquired through a similar process of voided inheritance or by some other means. In both cases, it would appear that the wills and purchase agreements contained insufficient information to define the boundaries precisely. This vagueness was presumably echoed by conditions on the ground, a state of affairs that must have contributed significantly to each dispute. In the Italian case, the judge seems to have been able to establish the boundary on the basis of some kind of evidence. Not enough of the text survives for us to be certain about the evidence employed, but it would appear that the property had been delimited in some way previously that was at least partially recoverable. In the Greek case, the judge’s verdict mandated a subsequent survey of the regions in question and an allocation of the requisite area beginning from a point of the winner’s choosing, a clear indication that the property in question had never been properly surveyed and delimited, or that too little evidence of such survived to be of any legal utility.</p>

<head>Restoration of the Boundaries of the Fields Consecrated to Diana Tifatina</head>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 77 or 78</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">The venerable sanctuary of <placeName type="ancient">Diana Tifatina</placeName> (now the modern church of <placeName type="modern">S. Angelo in Formis</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Italy</placeName>) lay just south of the <placeName type="ancient">Volturnus</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Volturno</placeName>) river at the northwestern end of the <placeName type="ancient">Mons Tifata</placeName>. As many as five boundary markers dating to AD 77 or 78 survived the Roman period to document the restoration of boundaries defining lands and plots belonging to the temple (Texts <ref target="ddoc:492"><bibl><biblScope>67.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:374"><bibl><biblScope>67.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). The emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> is credited with responsibility for the restoration, which was implemented on the basis of a map ascribed to the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName>. The lands in question had been dedicated to the goddess originally by the dictator <persName>Sulla</persName>following a victory in the area over the consul <persName>Gaius Norbanus</persName> in 83 BC; this origin is noted on the boundary markers and confirmed by a passage in Velleius Paterculus (Text <ref target="ddoc:491"><bibl><biblScope>67.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).<note n="402"> Vallat 1979, 984 thinks that <persName>Sulla’s</persName>‘donation’ to Diana should be seen as part of a larger and more complex series of land distributions in <placeName type="ancient">Campania</placeName>, attested by other sources but overlooked by Velleius. </note></p>
<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus’</persName> earlier involvement is obscure. It may be the case that the map was prepared in the course of resolving an earlier dispute touching on the same area.<note n="403"> Rigsby 1976, 321. </note> On the other hand, the restitution of temple lands has long been identified as a matter of special concern for <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName>,<note n="404"> Moatti 1993, 37, with sources and literature. </note> as has the more general stabilization of landholding of all types.<note n="405"> Campbell 1996, 95-98. </note> The Augustan map could have been made in the context of more general surveys associated with dispute resolution or veteran settlements in <placeName type="ancient">Campania</placeName>, and might well have indicated pre-existing ownership of land in the area that was not disturbed (or verified) during this period.<note n="406"> The confiscation of land from <placeName type="ancient">Capua</placeName>for veteran settlements by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName> is documented (ILS 6308 = CIL 10.3825, cf., Campbell 1996, 94 and note 88). It was in compensation for this loss that <placeName type="ancient">Capua</placeName> received a <foreign xml:lang="la">praefectura</foreign> in <placeName type="modern">Crete</placeName>. See Instance <ref target="#INST57"><bibl><biblScope>27</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> Any of these predilections or activities may have led to the creation of the map, but without more explicit testimony we cannot move beyond speculation.</p>
<p rend="indent">The path whereby <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> became involved in this matter is similarly unclear. Scholars generally assume that encroachment on the temple lands, either by local landholders or wealthy elites from <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName> with landed interests in <placeName type="ancient">Campania</placeName>, led to a case before the emperor that resulted in the restoration.<note n="407"> Thus Rigsby 1976, 321, following Mommsen (CIL 10, 367). </note> Where we do have unequivocal evidence for direct imperial involvement in the resolution of boundary disputes, this is the pattern we see. An aggrieved party brought the case to the emperor directly (if in <placeName type="modern">Italy</placeName> or if the case spanned provincial jurisdictions), or a governor – who needed advice or had to impose a solution in the absence of adequate evidence – consulted the emperor himself. What the particulars were in this affair, or who <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> employed to conduct local investigations and carry out the survey and emplacement of the new markers, we do not know.<note n="408"> The nature of the property consecrated to Diana Tifatina seems to have been different from that consecrated to Zeus Conditor at <placeName type="ancient">Aezanoi </placeName>in that Diana’s estates were worked by slave laborers under the supervision of a <foreign xml:lang="la">vilicus</foreign>(Carlsen 1994a and Carlsen 1995, 62-63). The sacred lands at <placeName type="ancient">Aezanoi</placeName>were leased for a fee. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">In the presentation of texts below, I have followed the arguments of De Franciscis 1966, who rehabilitates two early reports of markers that were suppressed by Mommsen at CIL 10.3828 as inferior modern copies of the text he edited. At issue is some variation in the texts. Some refer to <foreign xml:lang="la">agri</foreign> dedicated to the goddess, others refer to <foreign xml:lang="la">loci</foreign>. Both words are now securely attested on markers excavated in the 20th century. De Franciscis 1966, 245 considers two possible explanations, neither entirely satisfying, for the <seg type="term">variatio</seg>: perhaps <foreign xml:lang="la">loci</foreign> refer to parcels of land in mountainous terrain and <foreign xml:lang="la">agri</foreign> to cultivable fields in the plain, or perhaps <foreign xml:lang="la">loci</foreign> designate “<seg type="treForeign">l’area sacra, il temenos</seg>” and <foreign xml:lang="la">agri</foreign> the agricultural area. Absent the discovery of more markers, securely <seg type="term">in situ</seg>, we will be unable to move beyond speculation here.</p>

<head>Casting a Spell on the Governor in <placeName type="ancient">Hispania</placeName></head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, no. 7</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>first century AD?</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">Three lead tablets, inscribed in Latin on both sides and recovered from separate funerary vases near <placeName type="ancient">Emporion</placeName> (mod. Empúries in <placeName type="modern">Spain</placeName>), provide testimony for a <hi rend="bold">possible boundary dispute</hi> between two local peoples, the <placeName type="ancient">Indicetani</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Olossitani</placeName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">The coincidence of these two otherwise rare ethnic names<note n="292"> For the <placeName type="ancient">Olossitani</placeName>, see Lamboglia 1959. I have been unable to find any published information about the <placeName type="ancient">Indicetani</placeName>, either primary or secondary, despite assertions by the editors of IRC that they are “well known from the inscriptions.”  </note> in what is clearly a Roman judicial context has led most commentators to assume that a boundary dispute occasioned the creation and deposition of these tablets; however, there is no internal evidence to support this assumption.<note n="293"> This has led to a variety of speculative efforts at dating the inscriptions (which, as for most such deposits, must be later than the Augustan era data for the funerary vases). This in turn has led some commentators to connect the putative boundary dispute with a hypothetical reorganization of <placeName type="ancient">Emporion’s </placeName>territory following on from its promotion to the status of <foreign xml:lang="la">municipium</foreign>under the Flavian emperors. Such learned speculation, although valuable, is not directly germane to the purpose of this work, and so readers are referred to the cited editions for details. </note> The altercation could have concerned any conceivable grievance between two peoples, although we may consider a boundary or other land dispute as significantly likely.<note n="294"> I am aware of only one other such tablet that mentions a Roman governor, one <persName>Theodoros</persName>, governor of <placeName type="ancient">Cyprus</placeName>, although the context appears to have been a civil case involving two individuals (Gager 1992, 136-137 no. 46). Separately, I am aware of only one extant imprecation that mentions boundaries specifically, an inscribed curse on a statue base erected by the second century AD builder of a bath complex in <placeName type="ancient">Chalcis</placeName>. The curse aims to deter subsequent owners of the property from removing the statue or infringing upon a demarcated area surrounding it (Gager 1992, 184-185 no. 86).  </note></p>
<p rend="indent">These tablets are usually described as <foreign xml:lang="la">tabellae defixiones</foreign> or curse tablets, but it is probably more helpful to speak of them as the surviving physical elements of a binding spell evidently cast in an effort to prevent injustice in the legal proceedings.<note n="295"> A good descriptive overview of such inscribed objects and the various types of effects for which they were employed – including a critique of past scholarly approaches (with references) – may be found in Gager 1992, 3-30, together with the introduction to his selection of legal texts on pages 116-122. Note, however, the corrective provided by Vine 1993. On the “judicial curse,” intended not for revenge but to influence the trial itself, see also Faraone 1991a, 15. </note> Two of the three tablets (Texts <ref target="ddoc:363"><bibl><biblScope>30.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>and <ref target="ddoc:176"><bibl><biblScope>30.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) carry texts consisting entirely of somewhat repetitive lists of individuals and groups in the nominative case, with some genitive dependencies.<note n="296"> Repetition, iteration and enumeration are not uncommon features of such spells.  </note> The third tablet (Text <ref target="ddoc:364"><bibl><biblScope>30.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) is similar, and similarly repetitive, but includes at the end of one side an optative subjunctive construction that would appear to take all the nominatives in the list as its subject and thus reveal to us the principal aim of the spell: <foreign xml:lang="la">inique ne int[er]sint</foreign>, which I take to mean “may they not participate (in the trial) unjustly.”<note n="297"> The evident goal of many surviving spells that can be connected to Greek or Roman judicial proceedings was to prevent one’s opponents from speaking effectively at trial (Gager 1992, 118-119 and 132-136 no. 45), whereas this spell seems merely to seek the prevention of injustice (see Instance <ref target="#INST166"><bibl><biblScope>11</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> for a case in which a member of a governor’s <foreign xml:lang="la">consilium </foreign>was prepared to take a bribe in return for his influence in a boundary dispute, perhaps just the sort of situation that our spell’s commissioner here sought to prevent). On the use of wish formulae in binding spells, and the deployment of such spells as defensive measures, see Faraone 1991a, 5 and 9. </note> This interpretation is reinforced by the preceding phrase, in the nominative plural, which seems to modify either the entire list of subjects, or at least those immediately preceding the verbal clause: <foreign xml:lang="la">atve{ve}rsari mei</foreign> (my adversaries).<note n="298"> The translation at Gager 1992, 142-143 no. 52 is hopelessly inadequate and, consequently, the associated discussion unrewarding. Having decided that “the Latin is corrupt” (it is not) and having mistaken the Latin phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">consilium legati</foreign> for a nonsensical “council with jurisdiction over the <placeName type="ancient">Indicetani</placeName>” (and similarly confused variations throughout), the translator goes astray, ignoring entirely the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">atve{ve}rsari mei </foreign>and rendering<foreign xml:lang="la"> inique ne int[er]sint</foreign> as “... oppose me unfairly ...,” which strips it of its clear hortative force. In a Roman judicial context, the word <foreign xml:lang="la">consilium</foreign> can denote nothing other than the advisory council of the presiding magistrate. In this case that connotation is made even clearer by the text’s composer, who provides us with the dependent genitive <foreign xml:lang="la">legati</foreign>. Failing to recognize such a well-documented institution as the Roman magistrate’s <foreign xml:lang="la">consilium</foreign> reveals the irresponsiblity of the volume’s editor in proclaiming that, although “we know much about the formal aspects of ancient legal culture ... for our purposes, we may safely ignore these formal matters ...” (Gager 1992, 116). </note></p>
<p rend="indent">It is impossible in my view to ascertain who conducted or commissioned the spell and the deposition of the tablets, although the otherwise unknown <persName>Sempronius Campanus Fidentinus</persName> (the only named individual who is not clearly a Roman official) is an obvious candidate. On the other hand, it is worth noting that often curses and binding spells omitted the name of the commissioner, perhaps to avoid mistakenly catching them up in the spell’s effects. If all the individuals and groups appearing on the tablets in the nominative are meant to be taken as the subject of final clause’s verb – and are thus in agreement with the adjectival phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">atve{ve}rsari mei</foreign> – then <persName>Fidentinus</persName> cannot have been the spell’s commissioner.</p>

<head>Authoritative Demarcation between the <placeName type="ancient">Viennenses</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Ceutrones</placeName></head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, no. 8</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 74</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">A single boundary marker attests to an <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi>between <placeName type="ancient">Vienne</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Vienne</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">France</placeName>) and the <placeName type="ancient">Ceutrones</placeName> or <placeName type="ancient">Ceutronae,</placeName> inhabitants of <placeName type="ancient">Axima</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Aime</placeName>).</p>
<p rend="indent">The individual who carried out the demarcation, on the emperor’s authority, had in his own right no direct legal authority over the two cities whose territory was demarcated. As Aichinger points out, <persName>Cn. Pinarius Cornelius Clemens</persName> was commander of the army of <placeName type="ancient">Germania Superior</placeName>, whereas <placeName type="ancient">Vienna</placeName> was located in <placeName type="ancient">Gallia Narbonensis</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Axima </placeName>in <placeName type="ancient">Alpes Graiae et Poeninae</placeName>. The boundary between the two civic territories therefore was coincident with the provincial boundary. As a result, neither governor had the appropriate legal authority to adjust the boundary. That capacity fell to the emperor, and to anyone he might explicitly delegate for the purpose.<note n="460"> Aichinger 1982, 194-195.1. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">Aichinger goes on to assume that this demarcation must have derived from a boundary dispute, accompanied with some degree of unrest in the area, thus necessitating the appointment of an imperial delegate who could bring to bear sufficient military force to quiet the unrest and enforce the settlement. This is a great deal to read into a relatively terse inscription. This text includes none of the judicial terminology that we have established as criteria for identifying boundary disputes. It merely says that <persName>Clemens</persName> established the boundary on the authority of the emperor. The reasons for the demarcation and the choice of person, as well as the mechanism whereby the emperor’s authority was delegated, are not spelled out in any degree. There is no mention of unrest or enforcement. On the other hand, the fact that it is not a governor who conducts the demarcation is of significant interest, and reinforces Aichinger’s thesis concerning the necessity of direct imperial involvement with territorial boundaries, “<seg type="treForeign">die den </seg><seg type="treForeign"><seg type="T18">Jurisdiktionsbereich</seg></seg><seg type="treForeign">  </seg><seg type="treForeign"><seg type="T18">eines</seg></seg><seg type="treForeign">  </seg><seg type="treForeign"><seg type="T18">einzelnen</seg></seg><seg type="treForeign">  </seg><seg type="treForeign"><seg type="T18">Statthalters</seg></seg><seg type="treForeign">  </seg><seg type="treForeign"><seg type="T11">überschritten</seg></seg><seg type="treForeign">.</seg>”<note n="461"> Aichinger 1982, 193. </note></p>

<head>Boundary Disputes between <placeName type="ancient">Thasos</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Philippi</placeName>?</head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, nos. 25 and 63</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 69-79</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">Sometime during the reign of Vespasian, L. Venuleius Pataecius, the procuratorial governor of <placeName type="ancient">Thracia</placeName>, sent a letter to the city of <placeName type="ancient">Thasos </placeName>(on the homonymous island in the Thracian Sea). In his letter, he addressed a number of concerns that the city had clearly brought to his attention, presumably by way of a letter or decree delivered by an embassy. At least one of these concerns appears to have been a dispute with an unnamed colony, probably <placeName type="ancient">Philippi</placeName> (mod. Krenides). The governor wrote that he had delivered a verdict in the case, but its text is not extant. A number of other topics, including transport obligations associated with the <foreign xml:lang="la">cursus publicus</foreign> and appeals against unspecified earlier verdicts delivered by one Lucius Antonius,<note n="258"> Various theories about the identification and activities of this individual have been advanced. See the entries for L. Antoninus Saturninus and L. Antonius Naso in the Prosopographical Index. Given the context, Burton 2000, 211.63 supposes that this earlier decision also concerned boundaries. </note>are also addressed. Before the inscription breaks off, Pataecius discusses his provisions for resolving what was clearly a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi>, possibly the aforementioned matter involving <placeName type="ancient">Philippi</placeName>. He has sent a soldier (presumably a surveyor) to deal with “the boundaries,” and he promises the Thasians that, when he himself arrives, they will have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p rend="indent">Perhaps the most startling aspect of this letter is the involvement of the governor of <placeName type="ancient">Thracia</placeName>. The city of <placeName type="ancient">Thasos</placeName> was a nominally “free city” of Greece, but fell administratively within the province of <placeName type="ancient">Macedonia</placeName>. Why would a free Greek city of <placeName type="ancient">Macedonia</placeName> approach the governor of another province? The answer would seem to be that the problems addressed involved <placeName type="ancient">Thasos’</placeName> <foreign xml:lang="la">peraea</foreign> on the Thracian mainland, a well-attested possession from the 5th century BC onwards. This would explain a boundary dispute with <placeName type="ancient">Philippi</placeName>, and would also explain why the governor of <placeName type="ancient">Thracia</placeName> would have anything to say about transport obligations through <placeName type="ancient">Thasos’</placeName> territory. These are all matters on which the governor of <placeName type="ancient">Macedonia</placeName> can have had no influence.</p>

<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">A badly damaged inscription from <placeName type="ancient">Kierion</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Pyrgos Kieriou in Greece</placeName>) would seem to be the remnants of either an inscribed civic archive (analogous to the extensive archive wall from <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName>) or a more specifically focused evidentiary dossier (like the boundary stelae from <placeName type="ancient">Histria</placeName>).<note n="225"> See Texts <ref target="ddoc:449"><bibl><biblScope>43.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:451"><bibl><biblScope>43.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and Instance <ref target="#INST21"><bibl><biblScope>16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, respectively. </note> This inscription transmits to us the lacunose texts of three letters, all apparently related to a boundary dispute between the communities of <placeName type="ancient">Kierion</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Metropolis</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Palaiokastro Georgikon</placeName>), both situated in the fertile Thessalian plains of mainland <placeName type="modern">Greece</placeName> through which the various tributaries feeding the <placeName type="ancient">Peneios</placeName> river flow.</p>
<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">The inscription is too badly damaged to hazard a translation of the letters, but a significant amount of information can nonetheless be gleaned from it.<note n="226"> In the texts that follow this description, I have chosen not to reproduce the majority of the supplements printed in IG and reproduced in most subsequent editions.

<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">The first letter (Text <ref target="ddoc:197"><bibl><biblScope>2.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) is the most damaged of the three. It mentions a quarrel (l. 1), votes cast by secret ballot under oath (l. 2), and a verdict (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">κρίσις</seg></foreign>) resulting from the voting in which some quantity of something (presumably some measure of land) is declared to be Kierian, thirty-one measures to be Metropoleian, and five to belong to neither party (ll. 5-6).<note n="227"> Who might have owned or controlled the remaining land is utterly obscure. </note></p>
<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">The second letter (Text <ref target="ddoc:480"><bibl><biblScope>2.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) clarifies the situation for us somewhat. It is addressed to one <persName>[ --- ]paios Sabeinos</persName>, legate of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName> Caesar. This individual is surely <persName>C. Poppaeus Sabinus</persName>, governor of the combined provinces of <placeName type="ancient">Moesia, Achaia </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Macedonia</placeName>between AD 11 and 35, hence the date range for this dossier.

It emerges that <persName>Sabinus’</persName> letter<note n="228"> This letter is not extant. It cannot be the fragmentary Text <ref target="ddoc:197"><bibl><biblScope>2.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> which also mentions the detailed terms of the verdict and therefore must postdate the council’s decision. </note> had directed a judicial investigation (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">κρίσις</seg></foreign>) on some unspecified issues, clearly relevant to the boundary dispute, which <persName>Sabinus</persName> had discussed in person with the author in <placeName type="ancient">Aidepsos</placeName> on an earlier occasion (ll. 3-4). The author seems to say that he had put those questions to the council in <placeName type="ancient">Larissa</placeName>(?) on a particular day, that both parties had made presentations of their positions, and a verdict (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">κρίσις</seg></foreign>) had been reached by secret ballot under oath. The verdict seems to match that mentioned in Text <ref target="ddoc:197"><bibl><biblScope>2.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>: two-hundred and ninety-(eight) measures were declared Kierieisan, (thirty)-one measures (Metropoleian), and five measures unassigned.</p>
<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">The third letter (Text <ref target="ddoc:481"><bibl><biblScope>2.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) is also addressed to <persName>Sabinus</persName>, this time by an individual whose name is lost but whose title appears to have been <foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">[ --- </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">στρατη</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">]</seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">γὸς</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Θεσσαλῶν</foreign> (general of the Thessalians). He indicates that <persName>Sabinus</persName> had written to him and to some other group of people, probably the council (ll. 2-3). He uses nearly the same phrase as Text <ref target="ddoc:480"><bibl><biblScope>2.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>to say that the subject of <persName>Sabinus’</persName> letter had been the boundary dispute between the (<placeName type="ancient">Kierieis</placeName>) and the <placeName type="ancient">Metropoleitai </placeName>(l. 3). He reports the same verdict as Texts <ref target="ddoc:197"><bibl><biblScope>2.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>and <ref target="ddoc:480"><bibl><biblScope>2.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, reached under oath by secret ballot, namely that two hundred ninety-eight measures were (Kierieisan), some lost number were Metropoleitan, and five (were unclaimed) (ll. 4-7). The verdict (<foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">κρίσις</seg></foreign>) is mentioned in the penultimate line, in what may be a statement of hope that the verdict will be acceptable to <persName>Sabinus</persName>.</p>
<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">These documents are important to the present study for several reasons. First, they constitute one of the earliest pieces of documentary evidence for a boundary dispute under the empire. But, according to most commentators, they reflect a pre-imperial approach to provincial boundary disputes in which a Roman magistrate (or the Senate), petitioned by the parties to an inter-civic dispute, delegated the case to another state or body for resolution.<note n="229"> The process of third-party arbitration was well established amongst Greek states. Rome became an increasingly active player in this system as its interests in the east expanded, although the Republican Senate frequently chose to delegate arbitrations others requested of it to third parties, often after imposing limitations on the nature of the question to be decided (Ager 1989 passim and for Rome’s role especially, pp. 26-29).  </note> None of the other boundary disputes in the imperial period demonstrates the use of third-party arbitration. A transition must have occurred from Rome’s use of third-party arbitration (so evident in Republican-era documents) to the range of procedures we see in the evidence collected here: governors using the <foreign xml:lang="la">cognitio</foreign>procedure as well as <foreign xml:lang="la">iudices dati</foreign>, and the emperor employing special legates for those cases where a governor’s jurisdiction was inadequate or superseded by his own. That Sabinus’ apparent use of third-party arbitration should be roughly contemporaneous with evidence from elsewhere showing the standard imperial approaches already in use may mark the reigns of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName> and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Tiberius</persName> as the transitional period.</p>
<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">A note of caution is in order, however. The letters in this dossier make it very clear that the dispute was about boundaries (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τὴν</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Κιεριέων</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">τε</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">Μητροπολειτῶν</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑπόθεσιν</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">, </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἣν</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">εἶχον</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">περὶ</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρων</foreign><seg type="T6">)</seg>. Nonetheless, the verdict of the council, reiterated in all three letters, does not seem to have addressed the location or nature of the boundaries themselves. Rather, Sabinus seems to have asked the members of the council to rule on a particular question: how much land in a particular area belonged to each party (or neither). In this light, the present dispute takes on more than a passing resemblance to two other disputes that occurred during imperial times: the protracted second-century contest between <placeName type="ancient">Coronea</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Thisbe</placeName> over pasturage in an alpine meadow, and a similarly lengthy case involving <placeName type="ancient">Daulis</placeName> and a private individual.<note n="230"> <seg type="T35"/>Instances <ref target="#INST66"><bibl><biblScope>43</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="#INST138"><bibl><biblScope>42</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> In both of these cases, each of the parties was judged to have a rightful claim to a portion of a particular area. Subsequent to that decision, a survey and allocation were necessary to apportion the appropriate amounts to each party and to clearly delineate the boundaries that, evidently, could not be reconstructed with certainty from the evidence available. We can imagine, therefore, that Sabinus, upon receipt of the council’s collective opinion on apportionment, would have issued his own orders – perhaps in the form of a verdict – for the survey and marking of borders that fairly reflected each party’s share.</p>
<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">We may carry this line of speculation one step further. While it was the case that federal states in Hellenistic Greece were generally involved in most arbitrations between their members,<note n="231"> <seg type="T35">Ager 1989, 22-26.</seg> </note> Sabinus may have felt that the Thessalian council had particular reason to know about the relative rights of these two cities in the area in question. We cannot prove this hypothesis from the surviving evidence, but like so many other attested cases, this one may have had a long pedigree, stretching back to land distribution or another settlement, perhaps adjudicated by the council itself at an earlier date. Under circumstances like these it would have made practical sense for a busy governor to call for verification from a body whose earlier ruling one or the other party in a dispute was presenting as evidence in a case before him. </p>
<p type="treParaIndent_20_Char_20_Char">Whatever the circumstances of the delegation and the scope of the council’s involvement, it is clear that the authority for the resolution of the dispute lay with <persName>Sabinus</persName>. This circumstance follows the model of all of our other evidence. There is no indication that any provincial council had autonomous authority in resolving territorial disputes during the imperial age.<note n="232"> <seg type="T35">Burton 2000, 204.</seg> </note></p>

<head>Multiple Authoritative Demarcations Involving the Sacred Land of Artemis at <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName></head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, nos. 34, 35, 36, 37 and 39</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>prior to 23 BC; 6/5 BC; AD 84-88; AD 110-112</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">A growing number of boundary markers and other epigraphic texts from the area of <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Selçuk</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Turkey</placeName>) provides evidence for at least four major <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi>s there, carried out under the emperors <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName>, <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Domitian</persName> and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Trajan</persName>. None of them can be shown definitively to have originated in disputes. The Augustan projects should be seen as part of a much larger effort aimed at restoring the properties and prestige of Artemis’ famed temple (and her city), which had evidently suffered significant diminution during the Roman civil wars at the hands of successive, cash-hungry eastern commanders. Efforts to disambiguate both the ownership and extent of landed properties, roads and watercourses may imply that disputes occurred during these processes and thus required settlement, but none is explicitly documented. <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Domitian’s</persName> project, which on present evidence dealt only with agricultural property, took at least four years to complete under the supervision of each proconsul in succession. It has recently been connected to the establishment at <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName> of a perpetual gymnasiarch and an associated massive building project in the city center. A motivation for the Trajanic demarcation, which also addressed agricultural land, remains to be developed.</p>
<p rend="indent">The eleven boundary markers associated with authoritative imperial demarcations of agricultural land<note n="364"> Texts <ref target="ddoc:494"><bibl><biblScope>61.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:495"><bibl><biblScope>61.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="ddoc:200"><bibl><biblScope>61.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:502"><bibl><biblScope>61.16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> can be taken together with other finds<note n="365"> Three undatable boundary markers bearing the text <seg type="T8">ὅρος ἱεροῦ Ἀρτέμιδος </seg>(IEph 3503 = Knibbe 1979, 141.3; IEph 3504; IEph 3505).  </note> to demonstrate that, during the principate at least, the cult of Artemis benefited from income on at least three large areas of “sacred land.”<note n="366"> The following discussion summarizes the essential work on this subject to date: Knibbe 1979, Knibbe 1989, 223-226, <seg type="T15">Scherrer 1990</seg>, Alföldy 1991, Engelmann 1993, Içten 1998, 83.1, Engelmann 1998, 308-309 and Engelmann 1999, 143-146.4. </note> The assumption of most scholars working on this material is that these lands formed large, integral blocks; however, this is largely just an assumption. It is quite possible that the temple holdings were intermixed with other properties.<note n="367"> The findspots of the markers are indicated on the following maps: Knibbe 1979, 147, IEph 7.2, 296 and Engelmann 1999, 145. The discussion below makes use of physical and cultural landmarks explicitly labeled on BAtlas Maps 56 and 61. Most of the findspots are not marked there. </note> </p>
<p rend="indent">The first area probably extended from the immediate environs of the temple itself northeastward along the valley of the <placeName type="ancient">Cayster</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Küçük Menderes</placeName>) until the point at which the river turns north, near the mausoleum at <placeName type="modern">Belevi</placeName>. From there, this section of property continued eastward along the bottom of the shallow valley bounded on the south by the <placeName type="ancient">Messogis Mons </placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">Aydın Dağları</placeName>) and on the north by slightly rising land that extends from the <placeName type="modern">Belevi</placeName> quarries on the west to <placeName type="ancient">Almoura</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Eskioba</placeName>) on the east. Existing documentation takes the temple property only about half-way up this valley, to the modern sites of <placeName type="modern">Bühükkale </placeName>and <placeName type="modern">Hasançavuslar</placeName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">The second block of temple property lay further to the north and east. It seems to have occupied an area between <placeName type="ancient">Larisa</placeName>, <placeName type="ancient">Almoura </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">*Siklia</placeName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">The goddess also apparently owned property in the area of <placeName type="ancient">Metropolis </placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">Yeniköy</placeName>) as well, where to date only one boundary marker (<seg type="term">in situ</seg>) has been found.</p>
<p type="Heading_20_4">Demarcations and Other Beneficia of Augustus</p>
<p rend="indent">The direct evidence for the first of two boundary demarcations under <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus </persName>consists of three bilingual boundary markers that say simply that he “restored boundaries to Artemis” (Texts <ref target="ddoc:494"><bibl><biblScope>61.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>- <ref target="ddoc:495"><bibl><biblScope>61.3</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). Two of these markers were recovered in the first (southern) area of property, while a third was found (evidently not <seg type="term">in situ</seg>) in the town of <placeName type="modern">Selçuk</placeName>. Their emplacement cannot be dated precisely, but they are probably associated with an imperial restoration and (possibly) expansion of agricultural land belonging to the goddess, as indicated by other evidence.</p>
<p rend="indent">Three other epigraphic sources shed light on the nature and date of this event. The first is a bilingual inscription from <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName>, dating to ca. 23 BC. It records the improvement of part of a processional way sacred to Artemis<note n="368"> Mixed Language Inscriptions 148. </note> as a “<foreign xml:lang="la">beneficium </foreign>of Caesar Augustus, funded from the proceeds of the sacred fields that he gave (<foreign xml:lang="la">de[dit]</foreign> = <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐχαρί[σατο]</foreign>) <seg type="T8">to</seg> Diana” (Text <ref target="ddoc:508"><bibl><biblScope>61.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). The work was conducted under the direction of the proconsul of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>, <persName>Sextus Appuleius </persName>(hence the date). The second piece of relevant evidence is provided by a bilingual inscription that records the construction (in 6-5 BC) of a wall for the <foreign xml:lang="la">fanum </foreign>(<foreign xml:lang="grc">ναός</foreign>, presumably Artemis’ sanctuary) and an <foreign xml:lang="la">Augusteum</foreign>, all funded “from the (sacred) income of Diana (the goddess)” (Text <ref target="ddoc:510"><bibl><biblScope>61.5</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).<note n="369"> The implications and interpretative difficulties presented by this construction project – including the location and identification of the <foreign xml:lang="la">Augusteum </foreign>– are explored in Engelmann 1993 and Scherrer 1990. The wall in question is probably the peribolos wall, which identified the sacred precincts and the spatial extent of the sanctuary’s asylum (<seg type="treGreekTransliterated">asylia</seg>). See Rigsby 1996, 388-392 for further discussion. </note> The third relevant document is a fragmentary bilingual edict of an even later proconsul, <persName>Paullus Fabius Persicus</persName>, who served during the early years of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Claudius’ </persName>reign. The edict addresses a variety of matters touching on civic and temple administration, and in particular makes note of a deficiency of temple funds, apparently because of embezzlement. <persName>Persicus </persName>makes a special point of drawing attention to <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus’ </persName>earlier provisions in this area by restoring the goddess’ “copious income” (<foreign xml:lang="la">abundans vectigal</foreign>) (Text <ref target="ddoc:509"><bibl><biblScope>61.8</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). </p>
<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus </persName>apparently arranged for the identification and restoration of land that generated lease income for the temple of Artemis, and probably increased the amount of this land as well (although how this was accomplished – by purchase or appropriation – is unclear).<note n="370"> Compare lands owned and leased for income by the temple of Zeus at <placeName type="ancient">Aizanoi</placeName>, restored by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>, and lands owned and operated by the temple of Diana Tifatina in <placeName type="ancient">Campania</placeName>, restored by <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName>. </note> Whether the demarcation occurred at the same time as the gift of land is unclear, but given the restorative aspect of the project, this seems likely.</p>
<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus’</persName> <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia </foreign>at <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus </placeName>were not limited to the restoration and expansion of the goddess’ agricultural property. We have already seen that he arranged, through the proconsul, for the construction of a wall around the sanctuary of Artemis and an <foreign xml:lang="la">Augusteum</foreign>. Two other Greek inscriptions dating to the same year (6-5 BC) memorialize an additional project: his establishment of “sacred stelae of the roads and waterways for(?) Artemis” (Texts <ref target="ddoc:505"><bibl><biblScope>61.6</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>- <ref target="ddoc:506"><bibl><biblScope>61.7</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). The placement of these inscriptions identified parts of the urban fabric as the property of the goddess and clearly required survey, for these two examples each carry statements of the width of the roads and waterways so identified. The recording of widths for the roads and waterways in effect constitutes a boundary demarcation of sorts: the inscribed information then provided a basis on which encroachment or use of these spaces could be assessed. This survey cannot have been the same event as the restitution of the temple lands, which had been accomplished nearly twenty years before. </p>
<p rend="indent">This survey is frequently connected by modern scholars with a terribly fragmentary document whose letter forms are not inconsistent with the Augustan age.<note n="371"> Knibbe 1989, 223-224.59, where significant new fragments are tentatively related to some smaller ones, published earlier in IEph. </note> It includes some directional cues and personal names, and also probably mentions boundary-marking officials (<seg type="T8">ὁρισταί</seg>), earlier proclamations (<seg type="T8">τὰ προσεσημ</seg><seg type="T7">[</seg><seg type="T8">ειωμένα </seg><seg type="T7">???]), </seg>a local religious official with responsibility over something sacred <seg type="T7">(</seg><seg type="T8">οἰκονόμος</seg><seg type="T7">  </seg><seg type="T8">τῶν ἱερῶν τῶ</seg><seg type="T7">[</seg><seg type="T8">ν </seg><seg type="T7">---</seg><seg type="T8">  </seg><seg type="T7">]), </seg>sites<seg type="T7">(</seg><seg type="T8">τόποι</seg><seg type="T7">), </seg>a restoration<seg type="T7"> (</seg><seg type="T8">ἀποκατάστασις</seg><seg type="T7">), </seg>inscribed documents <seg type="T7">(</seg><seg type="T8">στήλαι</seg><seg type="T7">), </seg>and boundary markers<seg type="T7"> (</seg><seg type="T8">ὅροι</seg><seg type="T7">). </seg>It is important to note here that this document, though suggestive, is not clearly a boundary description, and cannot be definitively linked to any of the Augustan projects.<note n="372"> Whatever the precise nature of this document (perhaps a letter or civic decree), it is not recognizable as a straightforward <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁροθέσια</foreign>, and, <seg type="term">pace</seg> Burton 2000, 209.34, should not be considered as documentation of the earlier agricultural land demarcation. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">This pattern of imperial benefaction reinforces what we know about the larger agenda of the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName>. In his <seg type="treTitle">Res Gestae</seg>, <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName> celebrates the replacement of the treasures allegedly looted from the temples of <placeName type="modern">Asia Minor</placeName> by <persName>Antony</persName>. The subsequent attention to the financial health and good order of <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName> and its famous goddess,<note n="373"> Scherrer 1990. </note> though not highlighted in the <seg type="treTitle">Res Gestae</seg>, accords well with the attention and funds <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus </persName>lavished on temples at <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName>. It can be paralleled elsewhere in the empire as well.<note n="374"> See Alföldy 1991, 160-162 for discussion and sources. </note> As the benefactor <seg type="term">par excellence </seg>of both gods and men, Augustus enhanced and reinforced his position of preeminence. The mature application, in the context of imperial administration, of land survey and boundary demarcation foreshadows the remarkably consistent approach and language of our later examples. It clearly sprang from the intersection of already mature Greek and Roman traditions of land management and civic boundary demarcation.</p>

<p rend="indent">Six published boundary markers provide evidence for an extended demarcation effort during the reign of the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Domitian</persName> (Texts <ref target="ddoc:200"><bibl><biblScope>61.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:499"><bibl><biblScope>61.14</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>).<note n="375"> This overview derives from that presented at Engelmann 1999, 145-146. </note> The focus again was the agricultural property of Artemis, as evidenced both by their findspots (scattered across the areas described above) and by their texts: “boundary markers of the sacred estate of Artemis established.” We do not know when the process of survey began or ended, but our earliest marker (Text <ref target="ddoc:200"><bibl><biblScope>61.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) dates to the proconsular tenure of <persName>Sex. Iulius Frontinus</persName> (AD 84/85). The latest (Text <ref target="ddoc:500"><bibl><biblScope>61.12</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) dates to AD 87/88, the term of <persName>C. Vettulenus Civica Cerialis</persName>. There is at present no documentation for one of the intervening years (AD 85/86), but two markers (Texts <ref target="ddoc:497"><bibl><biblScope>61.10</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>and <ref target="ddoc:496"><bibl><biblScope>61.11</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) belong to AD 86/87 (<persName>P. Nonius Asprenas Caesius Cassianus</persName>). The other two carry <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Domitian’s</persName> titulature, but are damaged in the portion of the text that cites the proconsul. Text <ref target="ddoc:498"><bibl><biblScope>61.13</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> preserves the first letter of the proconsul’s name: <foreign xml:lang="grc">Φ</foreign>. There are three possible proconsular candidates known from this period: <persName>Sex. Iulius Frontinus</persName> (AD 84/85, cf., Text <ref target="ddoc:200"><bibl><biblScope>61.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>), <persName>L. Mestrius Florus</persName> (ca. AD 88/89) and <persName>M. Fulvius Gillo</persName> (ca. AD 89/90). If either of the latter two individuals were responsible, this would extend the project for another year or two. <persName>Frontinus</persName> is the most conservative supplement possible. The other fragmentary document (Text <ref target="ddoc:499"><bibl><biblScope>61.14</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) provides no clue as to the identity of its proconsul.</p>
<p rend="indent">The full context for the Domitianic demarcation remains obscure. There is contemporaneous evidence of imperial benefaction at <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName>, including the establishment of a “perpetual gymnasiarch” and associated construction in the city center.<note n="376"> Engelmann 1998, 308-309, Engelmann 1999, 144-145. </note> It may be that this work was funded on the proceeds from the land so demarcated. It is possible that the land in question constituted a new gift of the emperor (again by purchase or appropriation). On the other hand, we may have here yet another reidentification and restitution of lands already associated with the temple, perhaps those demarcated under <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Augustus</persName>, perhaps others. The embezzlement alluded to by the Claudian-era proconsul <persName>Paullus Fabius Persicus </persName>may indicate that the misappropriation and misuse of temple lands and proceeds was a recurrent problem at <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName> that perpetually required the attention of the Roman administration. If this speculation is correct, then the Domitianic project may well have had its origins in disputes and local elite competition. These disputes could have been generated by the efforts of the Roman administration and the local elite to identify funds to support the Domitianic building project and benefactions. </p>
<p type="Heading_20_4">The Trajanic Demarcation</p>
<p rend="indent">Unlike the Augustan and Domitianic efforts, no theory has been advanced as to the context or aims of the demarcation under Trajan. It is documented by two boundary markers (Texts <ref target="ddoc:501"><bibl><biblScope>61.15</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>and <ref target="ddoc:502"><bibl><biblScope>61.16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). Only one of these (Text <ref target="ddoc:501"><bibl><biblScope>61.15</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) can be dated, on the tenure of the proconsul Q. Fabius Postuminus, to AD 111/112. This document also mentions a <seg type="T8">διάταγμα</seg> (edict?) of Postuminus’ immediate predecessor, L. Baebius Tullus, so it would appear that this issue (whatever its nature) was also significant in duration. </p>

<p>Date(s): <date/></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">In a letter inscribed on the wall of the temple of Apollo at <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName>, the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>communicated a number of legal decisions concerning the conduct of the Pythian games and the organization of the Delphic Amphictyony, issues which had evidently been brought before him at some earlier date. In addition to other matters, the emperor made a partial ruling in a dispute between the Delphians and the Thessalians over the control and operation of a harbor.</p>
<p rend="indent"><persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> acknowledged that the Delphians had already proved that they had purchased some (evidently related) land (<foreign xml:lang="grc">δόντες ὑπὲρ τῆς χώρας</foreign>) from the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> for a sum of 30 talents. In order to “ensure that (the Delphians) might have [title to both the] harbor and the pasturages (or districts? = <foreign xml:lang="grc">τῶν</foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T2">  </seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">νομῶν</foreign>) and [title] in every respect”, <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> assigned the otherwise unknown <persName>Claudius Timocrates</persName> to collect and send to him a number of Amphictyonic decrees which were “in conflict with one another or with the laws of society, in order that an investigation also of these (might) be made.” It is not unreasonable to assume that the existence of such conflicting documents was an extenuating circumstance raised by Thessalian representatives arguing the case before <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> once it became clear that the Delphians could prove title at least to the land in question. Nothing more is known of this matter, but surely, had <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> issued later favorable rulings in the case, these too would have been inscribed on the wall of the temple. Fragments of other letters of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName> to <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName> do survive, but these are too fragmentary to permit an assessment of their content.</p>
<p rend="indent">The case in question is not necessarily a boundary dispute. Ownership of land and a harbor, combined with the right to operate (and presumably profit from) the harbor were initially contested. It is possible that the problematic Amphictyonic decrees may have touched on boundary matters, and might then have led to the need for adjudication of boundaries on site, the dispatch of a surveyor, or similar measures.</p>

First, it is in no way clear from the surviving documents that <persName>Antiochos </persName>had seized public lands of <placeName type="ancient">Daulis</placeName>. Rather, he purchased land from an estate, and there was a dispute over the exact location of these properties. It may be that <placeName type="ancient">Daulis</placeName> had purchased (or been given) the rest, or had claimed a right to them in consequence of some legal difficulty with the inheritance (compare Instance <ref target="#INST101"><bibl><biblScope>60</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). Second, there is no indication in the documents that <persName>Maximos</persName>, the proconsul who initially delegated the case to <persName>Mummios</persName>, expressed or felt any embarrassment or difficulty over the case. Third, no one is represented as communicating any aspect of the case to the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>. <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian’s</persName> only appearance in the documents is as an element in the dating formula. </note> </p>
<p rend="indent">It seems that <persName>Antiochos</persName> had purchased land in four different locales (two of them adjoining) from the heirs of a single estate. In these locales, it would appear that the rest of the land was owned by the city of <placeName type="ancient">Daulis</placeName> itself, or that <placeName type="ancient">Daulis </placeName>had a claim of some kind against the estate in question. A dispute arose between the new owner and the city because the description of the purchased property evidently contained only the names of the locales and the area measurements of the property purchased in each. <persName>Euboulos </persName>verified <persName>Antiochos’</persName> claim on the basis of documentary evidence and then established a procedure for a survey in each locale to establish the boundaries and extent of <persName>Antiochos’ </persName>property, ensuring the inclusion of the requisite land area in each.</p>
<p rend="indent">Like the dispute between the city of <placeName type="ancient">Histria</placeName> and a tax contractor,<note n="323"> <seg type="T18">Instance </seg><seg type="T18"><ref target="#INST21"><bibl><biblScope>16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref></seg><seg type="T18">.</seg> </note> as well as the fragmentary dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Ostia</placeName> and various private parties,<note n="324"> <seg type="T18">Instance </seg><seg type="T18"><ref target="#INST101"><bibl><biblScope>60</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref></seg><seg type="T18">. </seg>See the relevant catalog entry for more discussion on the similarities and differences between these two cases. </note> these documents demonstrate the way in which standard descriptions of property in unsurveyed land could fuel disputes that required the intervention of Roman jurisdiction and, ultimately, a formal survey to secure a settlement. Another notable feature of these arrangements is the explicit grant of authority to <persName>Antiochos</persName> to pick the origin point for the survey in each locale. </p>

His order to this effect provided an authoritative endorsement of the validity of the boundary, and this is probably the reason it is cited in the inscribed text.

<p rend="indent">As I see it, this private dedication records a former centurion’s grim satisfaction upon completing the clearing of a blocked right-of-way that split his holdings. The use of the term <foreign xml:lang="la">limes</foreign>, combined with a requirement to keep said boundaries clear, indicates that the land in question must have qualified as <foreign xml:lang="la">ager divisus et assignatus </foreign>(divided and allocated land). This legal requirement is most clearly explained in the <seg type="treTitle">de condicionibus agrorum </seg>of <persName>Siculus Flaccus</persName>:</p>
<p type="treBlock">It is right that <foreign xml:lang="la">limites</foreign>, as I said above, should always be passable for rights of way and for conducting surveys. ... In some regions when the <foreign xml:lang="la">limites </foreign>encroach on actual farm buildings, the owners of the farm buildings construct gates, install doors, and position slaves beside them with the task of allowing people a passage through, since a serviceable right of way ought to be maintained for the people. Now, a right of way is granted by landholders on the understanding that they may occupy the <foreign xml:lang="la">limites</foreign>, but on this condition, namely, if farm buildings have been situated on <foreign xml:lang="la">limites</foreign>, that is, <foreign xml:lang="la">limites </foreign>on which they encroach, the owners must provide a right of way for the people through their land, provided that the route is no more difficult than that through the farm buildings ... I do not think that anyone should take over a <foreign xml:lang="la">limes </foreign>for cultivation, on the grounds that he prefers to offer a right of way through a field.<note n="345"> <foreign xml:lang="la">qui tamen, ut supra diximus, semper [in] itineribus &lt;et&gt; mensuris agendis peruii oportet ut sint. ... quibusdam regionibus, cum in ipsis incidant uillis, portas domini uillarum faciunt ianuasque inponunt et seruos huic negotio ad transmittendum populum applicant, quoniam utilissimum iter populo seruari debeat. datur autem uia a possessoribus, ut limites occurrent; hac tamen condicione, ut si &lt;u&gt;illae in limitibus positae sint, id est limites in quibus incidunt, &lt;red&gt;dant per agros suos iter populo, dum non deterius quam per &lt;u&gt;illas transeant. sed quaedam ita positae sunt, ut quantumcumque de limite deflectere uelint, incommodum iter patiantur: ita necessario per ipsas transeunt uillas. limitem autem non puto quemquam occupare debere colendo, ut per agrum iter reddere mallet: alioquin deflexus illi, qui de limite detorquentur, multo maiorem occupant modum </foreign>(Campbell 2000, 124 l. 28 - 126 l. 5; translation is Campbell’s). </note></p>
<p rend="indent"><persName>Valens </persName>therefore owned property that had previously been divided and distributed in accordance with Roman colonial procedure, probably to discharged military veterans such as himself. That <persName>Valens </persName>considered the governor’s decision a heavy task is perhaps indicated by his choice of Hercules as the object of his dedication. The use of the unparelleled phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">ob decr(etum)</foreign>for the more common <foreign xml:lang="la">ex decreto </foreign>nonetheless clearly indicates that the governor’s mandate was delivered as a verdict in a case heard according to the <foreign xml:lang="la">cognitio </foreign>procedure.<note n="346"> <foreign xml:lang="la">ob decr(etum) </foreign>is Wilkes’ reading and supplement, improving upon <foreign xml:lang="la">ob dec(essionem) </foreign>as printed at CIL 3.8663, the source of much confusion for scholars who overlook Wilkes’ edition, which was informed by direct autopsy of the inscription (e.g., Burton 2000 no. 20 and Campbell 2000, 459 who both have written that the closing of the <foreign xml:lang="la">limes</foreign> must have had something to do with “the departure or death of the governor.”). </note> It seems likely that another landowner, or perhaps the community that had territorial jurisdiction over the allocated area, brought a case against <persName>Valens </persName>in which they alleged his failure to keep the standard right-of-way clear across his holdings. The governor ruled in the plaintiff’s favor, requiring <persName>Valens </persName>to undertake the clearing of the <foreign xml:lang="la">limes</foreign>. It is not clear whether the path of the <foreign xml:lang="la">limes</foreign> itself was at issue as well, for <persName>Valens </persName>was memorializing his compliance with the verdict, not the details of the case. If he had argued that the line of the <foreign xml:lang="la">limes </foreign>followed a different (unblocked) route than that alleged by the plaintiff, or that he had already provided an adequate alternate route in the manner described by <persName>Siculus Flaccus</persName>, he must have failed to prove it.</p>

<p rend="indent">It seems likely that the survey and restoration effort originated in a dispute between the parties, and so we should see the role of the governor (<persName>L.

The appearance of the emperor’s titulature in what appears to be the nominative case certainly seems to imply the emperor’s direct involvement in the affair, although this argument hinges solely on the word <foreign xml:lang="la">Caesar, </foreign>where it is possible that an inflected ending has been dropped. If the emperor’s name had appeared in the ablative, we might be looking at a date formula or a statement of the authority under which the case was handled. What remains of the second name (which we restore on the model of other boundary markers as <persName>Regulus’ </persName>and in the ablative) also lacks any inflected endings. To make matters worse, we lack both the main verb and any participle that might agree with one or the other name in an oblique case. Consequently, there is little point in speculating on details of individual roles. On the model of our more complete texts that mention verdicts, we may hypothesize that, as legate in <placeName type="ancient">Lusitania</placeName>, <persName>Regulus</persName> was indeed the Roman official who heard this case and issued the verdict, possibly having consulted the emperor or having received relevant general directions from him.<note n="223"> Le Roux 1994, 40 argues sensibly that <persName>Regulus’ </persName>role should be seen as a routine mission in context of his command in the province, and not a special mission, i.e., he was not a special legate of the emperor like <persName>Nigrinus</persName>, but a provincial governor dealing with a boundary dispute in the course of his regular duties. </note> Without further evidence or the recovery and publication of the missing portion of this inscription, we cannot responsibly say more. </p>

<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, no. 38</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 110-111</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">A recently published epigraphic text, probably from the area of <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia Salbakes</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Medet</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Turkey</placeName>) attests to a dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Herakleia Salbakes</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Vakıf</placeName>) and another city (probably <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia</placeName>) that centered on the territorial rights to, and the boundaries of, two otherwise unknown villages, <placeName type="ancient">Kosa</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Antikosa</placeName>. The inscription dates to ca. AD 110-111 and records the demarcation of the two villages by the previously unknown <persName>C. Valerius Victor</persName>, serving as <foreign xml:lang="la">legatus pro praetore</foreign> to the proconsul of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>, <persName>L. Baebius </persName><persName><seg type="T6">Τ</seg></persName><persName>ullus</persName>.</p>
<p rend="indent">The initial Roman administrative engagement with the affair was conducted some thirty years earlier by <persName>T. Pomponius Bassus</persName>. His office is not made explicit in our text, but it seems most likely that he judged the case in AD 79 or 80 while serving as legate to the proconsul of the province of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>, <persName>M. Ulpius Traianus</persName>.<note n="306"> Haensch 1999, 126-128 considers three other possibilities for <persName>Bassus</persName> beyond that of legate to the proconsul: a special mission from the emperor for the resolution of boundary disputes (Haensch advances no argument or evidence for this possibility), an otherwise unattested proconsulate of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>(unlikely given a relatively full slate of known consuls and proconsuls in the correct years for <persName>Bassus’</persName> <foreign xml:lang="la">cursus</foreign>), and an appointment by the emperor to serve as <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> in Rome(!?) in a legal case between <placeName type="ancient">Herakleia</placeName> and (presumably) <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia</placeName>. This latter suggestion should be rejected, though Haensch considers it the most likely of the three possibilities. There is no evident reason why a dispute between <placeName type="ancient">Herakleia</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia </placeName>should have come to the emperor’s attention. Both cities were situated within the province of <placeName type="ancient">Asia </placeName>and should therefore have come under the jurisdiction of the proconsul. The proconsul might have consulted the emperor on questionable aspects of the case or one of the parties might have brought a petition directly to the emperor, but in none of our examples do we find the emperor taking such a case away from the governor and giving it to a legate. It is only in those cases where a land dispute spans a provincial boundary or involves cities or landholding entities with special status (compare <placeName type="ancient">Delphi</placeName>) that the emperor employs a special legate or <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign>. Furthermore, in all the documented cases of boundary adjudication by <foreign xml:lang="la">iudices dati ab imperatore</foreign>, the <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex </foreign>conducts his investigation of the case and delivers his verdict on site, not in <placeName type="modern">Rome</placeName>. In the absence of further direct evidence, the simplest solution here is clearly the best: we can independently place <persName>Bassus </persName>in <placeName type="ancient">Asia </placeName>as a propraetorian legate of the proconsul in AD 79-80. In that capacity, he probably assisted the proconsul by adjudicating this dispute. </note> The question seems to have been one of control over the two villages (with, we may suppose, consequences for taxation and other matters). The findspot of the inscription, according to Haensch’s correspondent, was approximately two kilometers from <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia</placeName>. <persName>Bassus’s</persName> verdict evidently identified the villages as within the <foreign xml:lang="la">ius territorii</foreign> of <placeName type="ancient">Herakleia</placeName>, which was located over 10 km to the north of <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia</placeName> on the opposite side of the high plain that lies between the <placeName type="ancient">Kadmos Mons</placeName> (the mod. <placeName type="modern">Babadağ</placeName>) to the north, the <placeName type="ancient">Salbake Mons </placeName>(the mod. <placeName type="modern">Bozdağ</placeName>) to the east, and other high ground on the south and west. On what grounds <persName>Bassus</persName> made his decision, we are not informed. The proximity of the villages to <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia</placeName> may provide the general background, with the case being brought because of encroachment by <placeName type="ancient">Apollonia</placeName> or the resurrection of long-dormant claims to control by one or the other party. The case may also have involved a sanctuary, since the ‘dedication’ of both villages to the goddess Artemis Sbryallis (an otherwise unattested epithet) is made explicit alongside mention of <persName>Bassus’</persName> verdict, but the details are obscure. We may hypothesize that income from these villages (they must then have had associated agricultural property) had been set aside for the maintenance of Artemis’ sanctuary, which must therefore have been located at or near Herakleia.<note n="307"> Compare other examples of disputes and demarcations involving temple lands evidently used for such purposes: Instances <ref target="#INST16"><bibl><biblScope>39</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, <ref target="#INST116"><bibl><biblScope>61</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>, <ref target="#INST103"><bibl><biblScope>67</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> and <ref target="#INST69"><bibl><biblScope>68</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note> </p>
<p rend="indent">The inscription is similarly terse when it comes to the reasons for the later demarcation. This demarcation was carried out by the proconsul L. Baebius Tullus in AD 110 and carried out on the ground by a legate on Tullus’ staff, C. Valerius Victor. This project (and possibly Bassus’ earlier decision as well) was conducted in accordance with <seg type="T8">the order</seg> (edict?) of Trajan (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξ ἐπιταγῆς Αὐτοκράτορος</foreign><seg type="T8">)</seg>. On the face of it, neither governor would have needed <seg type="T8">the</seg> emperor’s involvement in a dispute that fell within the scope of his own provincial jurisdiction. We do have evidence, however, of disputes that went to the emperor packaged together with other requests, such as those involving the confirmation of <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficia</foreign>. Governors also clearly consulted the emperor on difficult questions of law or procedure in the context of boundary disputes, and had the benefit of advice from surveyors assigned by him. It may have been that one of the parties appealed the earlier decision to the emperor, or complained that the territory in question was being encroached upon by the other party, necessitating a survey and demarcation. If we are correct in our hypothesis that the revenue from <placeName type="ancient">Cosa</placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Anticosa</placeName> was intended for the maintenance of Artemis’ sanctuary at <placeName type="ancient">Herakleia</placeName>, then Trajan’s edict may be analogous to those issued by Domitian and Trajan regarding the sacred land of Artemis at <placeName type="ancient">Ephesus</placeName>.<note n="308"> Texts <ref target="ddoc:200"><bibl><biblScope>61.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref> - <ref target="ddoc:502"><bibl><biblScope>61.16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>. </note></p>

<head>An Authoritative Demarcation in <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName> Brings Honor to the Severi</head>

<p>Date(s): <date>ca. AD 209?</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">A fragmentary inscription on a broken cylindrical marker found near mod. Sarayköy in Turkey attests to an authoritative demarcation, carried out by a provincial quaestor, apparently at the behest of the proconsul of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>. The inscription provides us with the probable identity of the quaestor (Maximius Attianus), and the possible identity of a heretofore unknown proconsul (L. Sempronius Senecio). The names of parties whose property or territory was delimited have not survived. This inscription has been discussed as evidence of a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi>.<note n="507"> Thus Burton 1993, 20-21, who insists that “<seg type="treForeign">l’inscription fait incontestablement allusion au règlement d’un conflit de limites.</seg>” </note> I cannot support this conclusion. It is true that the word <foreign xml:lang="la">determin[avit ---]</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="la">determin[atio --- ]</foreign> appears; therefore the inscription certainly concerns a boundary in some way. The appearance of the quaestor’s name in the nominative (as subject of the verb <foreign xml:lang="la">determinavit</foreign>?) and the putative proconsul’s name in the ablative might signal that the latter had appointed the former as <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> in a boundary dispute, but the word <foreign xml:lang="la">missus</foreign> is not sufficiently explicit for us to be certain of this. We cannot even be certain that the word beginning <foreign xml:lang="la">determin</foreign>is the main verb in the sentence. To call this incident a dispute is pushing a lacunose and already heavily supplemented text rather far. In fact, the document preserves none of the diagnostic vocabulary that would be necessary for us to definitively classify this incident as a dispute. Moreover, the inscription begins with the phrase <foreign xml:lang="la">in h(onorem) DD(ominorum) Impp(eratorum)</foreign>, and is the only boundary marker I have found to do so. It seems more likely to me that this inscription records the restoration or expansion of boundaries – perhaps as a <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficium</foreign>, perhaps as the outcome of a dispute – and so should be compared primarily with the beneficence of the Severi to the <placeName type="ancient">Thuddedenses</placeName> in <placeName type="ancient">Africa</placeName> and of Hadrian to <placeName type="ancient">Abdera</placeName> in <placeName type="ancient">Thracia</placeName>, both memorialized by the recipients with inscriptions that were honorific in tone.</p>

Here we are clearly in the domain of the formal processes of <foreign xml:lang="la">amicitia </foreign>practiced by the Roman elite. Agrippa suffers the public severing of his relationship with a patron (<foreign xml:lang="la">renuntiatio amicitiae</foreign>) by virtue of his betrayal of trust.<note n="252"> In general, see: Kierdorf 1987 passim, esp. pp. 230-231. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">The outcome of the boundary dispute, and <persName>Flaccus’</persName> handling of it, are left to our imagination. But where this text lacks some of the details we might expect from an epigraphic record, it provides a truly rare glimpse behind the scenes of Roman governance. This proconsul at least seems to have expected his <foreign xml:lang="la">amici</foreign> to serve as impartial advisors, and he was prepared to take necessary steps to root out corruption in their ranks. That he was willing to entertain accusations of corruption from one member of his <foreign xml:lang="la">consilium</foreign> against another is a testament to his vigilance, and a demonstration of the scope for both personal rivalry and surreptitious self-enrichment inherent in the Roman style of provincial jurisdiction.</p>

<head>Authoritative Demarcation between <placeName type="ancient">Dorylaion</placeName> and Another City</head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, no. 72</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>AD 117-138</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">A fragmentary boundary marker found built into the minaret of a mosque in the modern town of <placeName type="modern">Mutalıp</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Turkey</placeName> provides evidence for an <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi>between the nearby city of <placeName type="ancient">Dorylaion</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Şarhüyük</placeName>), located in the province of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>, and another city whose name is mostly lost.</p>
<p rend="indent">The text indicates that the boundary markers were placed according to an order (<foreign xml:lang="grc">κατὰ κέλευσιν</foreign><seg type="T6">) of t</seg>he emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>, whose titulature is abbreviated. It is on the basis of this phrase that the inscription is dated. The placement of the markers was carried out by one <persName>C. Iulius Severus</persName>, who is styled simply as <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian’s</persName>propraetorian legate (<foreign xml:lang="grc">διὰ ... πρεσβ(ευτοῦ) αὐτοῦ ἀντιστρατήγου</foreign>). His function in a proconsular province must be divined from other evidence, and this effort has exercised modern scholars in a process of debate that – in the absence of additional clarifying evidence – cannot be fully resolved.</p>
<p rend="indent">In the normal course of things, we would expect to find the provincial governor handling boundary demarcations involving cities of his own province. He would accomplish this in one of two ways: by seeing to the matter himself, or by delegating it to another individual with appropriate authority (for example, a legate on his staff). If the demarcation involved a dispute, he could also delegate the judicial process to a Roman citizen (or panel thereof), acting as <foreign xml:lang="la"><seg type="T6">iudex datus </seg></foreign>(a well-attested procedure modeled on the formulary process of the Roman private law). <persName>Severus </persName>is otherwise attested as “legate in <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>,”<note n="489"> See notes <bibl><biblScope type="note">492</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl> and <bibl><biblScope type="note">494</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl>. </note> and this would seem to settle the matter, but for the identification of the other city mentioned on the inscription.</p>
<p rend="indent">As is common in both the Latin and Greek boundary inscriptions, the plural ethnic name of a city’s inhabitants is used in this inscription. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δορυλαέων </foreign>presents no problem: it is the well-attested genitive plural form of the relevant ethnic. All that remains of the genitive plural ethnic of the other city’s people is a stem and the inflected ending: <foreign xml:lang="grc">-αιεων</foreign><seg type="T6">. </seg>There seems to be room for at most one character at the beginning of line 2 before the alpha; there is also a lacuna that might admit five or six characters at the end of the preceding line, immediately following <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δορυλαέων</foreign>. The first three of these characters ought to be <foreign xml:lang="grc">καὶ</foreign>, leaving only 3 or 4 characters to complete the name. There are only two attested communities in the area whose names might be supplied here: <placeName type="ancient">Midaion </placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">Kütahya</placeName>, less than 30 km to the east, gen. pl. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μιδαιέων</foreign>) and <placeName type="ancient">Nicaea </placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">İznik</placeName>, over 90 km to the northwest and in the province of <placeName type="ancient">Bithynia</placeName>, gen. pl. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νικαιέων</foreign>).<note n="490"> The variant spelling <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μιδαιεύς </foreign>seems to be attested only by StByz s.v., <foreign xml:lang="grc">Μιδάειον</foreign>. <foreign xml:lang="grc">Νικαιεύς </foreign>is common in both ancient literature and the epigraphy. </note> The original editors rejected the possible supplement <foreign xml:lang="grc">[καὶ Μι/δ]αιέων </foreign>on the grounds that it “conflicts with ... the traces on the stone” whereas <foreign xml:lang="grc">[καὶ Νι/κ]αιέων </foreign>does not. This critical observation is not explained in more detail. Despite the fact that the findspot is very close to <placeName type="ancient">Dorylaion </placeName>and <placeName type="ancient">Medaion </placeName>is much closer than <placeName type="ancient">Nicaea</placeName>, the choice of <placeName type="ancient">Nicaea </placeName>has been followed by most modern scholars.<note n="491"> The only published objection is voiced more recently by Şahin 1986, 140-141 note 55, who argues cogently against the original editors’ assumption that the stone had been carried to its findspot from somewhere to the north on the watershed of the <placeName type="modern">Bozdağ </placeName>(“<seg type="treForeign">dem Grenz-Berg zwischen Nikaia und Dorylaion</seg>”). He cites the ready availability of reusable finished stone in the immediate vicinity from a number of ancient sites. Therefore, he continues, given the argument of proximity, we must rehabilitate the supplement <foreign xml:lang="grc">[καὶ Μι/δ]αιέων</foreign>. Matters are not helped by the fact that, according to Şahin, the stone cannot now be found. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">Scholars who have accepted <placeName type="ancient">Nicaea </placeName>as the other city in this demarcation have been forced to deal with difficulties presented by <persName>Severus’ </persName>role in the matter. Apart from his identification in this inscription as an imperial legate, we also have his cursus on honorific inscriptions <seg type="T6">from </seg><placeName type="ancient"><seg type="T8">Ancyra</seg></placeName><placeName type="ancient">  </placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">Ankara</placeName>), making him, at one time or other, <foreign xml:lang="la">curator</foreign> of <placeName type="ancient">Bithynia-Pontus </placeName>and proconsul of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>.<note n="492"> There are two extant copies, which differ in some minor particulars: Bosch 1967, 197.156 = IGR 4.174 = ILS 8826 and Bosch 1967, 198.157 = IGR 4.175: <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρὸς ε’ ῥάβδους πεμφθέντα εἰς Βειθυνίαν διορθωτὴν καὶ λογιστὴν ὑπὸ θεοῦ </foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc"><seg type="T11">Ἁ</seg></foreign><foreign xml:lang="grc">δριανοῦ.</foreign><seg type="T8">  </seg>He is called<seg type="T7">  </seg><foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνθύπατος Ἀσίας</foreign><seg type="T8">  </seg>only in the second inscription. The Bithynian appointment is confirmed by Cass. Dio 69.14.4. See Bosch 1967, 197-204 for extended discussion of these and other relevant texts. </note> His proconsulate can be dated securely to ca. AD 152/3 and so need not trouble us further here. Most scholars doubt that he can have conducted a boundary demarcation involving a city of <placeName type="ancient">Asia </placeName>while serving in <placeName type="ancient">Bithynia-Pontus</placeName>, for this would have undermined the authority of the proconsul of <placeName type="ancient">Asia</placeName>.<note n="493"> But note Robert 1940a, 321 note 2, who attributed the boundary demarcation to <persName>Severus’</persName> curatorship in <placeName type="ancient">Bithynia-Pontus</placeName> and then theorized that we have evidence here of a change in the boundary of the two provinces, incorporating <placeName type="ancient">Dorylaion </placeName>in <placeName type="ancient">Bithynia-Pontus </placeName>at this date. Contra, see Aichinger 1982, 198 note 19. </note> But a legate on the staff of the proconsul of <placeName type="ancient">Asia </placeName>whose brief was confined to that province would also seem an unlikely candidate for such a trans-provincial task, similarly undermining the authority of the governor in <placeName type="ancient">Bithynia-Pontus</placeName>. Closer inspection of the cursus inscriptions provides the solution to this problem. <persName>Severus </persName>was serving as a special legate of the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Hadrian</persName>, in accordance with an imperial letter and <foreign xml:lang="la">mandata</foreign>.<note n="494"> <foreign xml:lang="grc">πρεσβεύσαντα ἐν Ἀσίαι ἐξ ἐπιστολῆς κὲ κωδικίλλων θεοῦ Ἀδριανοῦ</foreign><seg type="T7">.</seg><seg type="T8"> This</seg> is the conclusion of Aichinger 1982, 197-198.4, reiterated by Thomasson 1991, 78. See both for earlier literature and discussion. </note> These arrangements may well have attached him to the proconsul’s staff in Asia (this is undocumented), but granted him additional authority to deal with other matters. Whether this letter (or the <foreign xml:lang="la">mandata</foreign>) directly addressed the boundary issue involving <placeName type="ancient">Dorylaion </placeName>is a matter entirely of speculation. <persName>Severus’ </persName>task may have been more generally defined.</p>
<p rend="indent">Despite the difficulties presented by this damaged inscription, our model of administrative responsibility for civic (and related) boundaries can accommodate the various possible reconstructions. If both cities involved in this demarcation lay within the province of Asia, then the proconsul could have delegated the matter to any authoritative figure he chose. If the two cities lay in different provinces, then we must accept a special imperial mission (or at least special instructions from the emperor that conferred additional authority) on Severus. It is important to remember, however, that nothing about this text guarantees that the demarcation arose from a dispute.</p>

<head>Restoration of Roman Public Lands in Cyrenaica</head>
<p rend="indent">Burton 2000, nos. 73 and 74</p>
<p>Date(s): <date>beginning AD 53</date></p>
<p type="treDisputeStatement">What follows here can only be a provisional account of Roman administrative measures relating to the restoration of public land in <placeName type="ancient">Cyrenaica</placeName>. These matters are informed by literary references, and by a substantial number of inscribed boundary markers dating to the reigns of Claudius, Nero and Vespasian. I cannot provide a complete list, nor can I provide any useful topographic or temporal overview, for the majority of these inscriptions (despite their discovery over thirty years ago) remain unpublished.<note n="378"> J. Reynolds could speak of 28 of them in 1971, when only seven of them had appeared (Reynolds 1971, 47). The complete publication promised then has yet to appear, although J. Reynolds remains actively engaged in its preparation (pers. comm.). Previously unknown markers are still being found, e.g., Texts 1.8 and 1.12. </note></p>
<p rend="indent">At the end of his narrative of the year AD 59, Tacitus reports on unspecified accusations brought before the Senate against L. Acilius Strabo (Text <ref target="ddoc:471"><bibl><biblScope>62.1</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). Strabo had earned the enmity of the Cyrenaicans through a task he had been given in their province by the emperor Claudius: the adjudication of Roman public lands that had been occupied by squatters. The land in question, according to Tacitus, had been bequeathed to the Roman people by Ptolemy Apion, king of <placeName type="ancient">Cyrene </placeName>(reigned ca. 105-101 – 96 BC). Not being party to the details of Strabo’s mission, the Senate had to refer the matter to Nero. Nero exonerated Strabo and confirmed his verdicts, but then granted the land to the provincials as a <foreign xml:lang="la">beneficium</foreign>.</p>
<p rend="indent">Strabo’s tenure in <placeName type="ancient">Cyrenaica</placeName> is attested epigraphically by eight published inscriptions (Texts <ref target="ddoc:476"><bibl><biblScope>62.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>to <ref target="ddoc:514"><bibl><biblScope>62.8</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). Those that can be dated (Texts <ref target="ddoc:476"><bibl><biblScope>62.2</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>to <ref target="ddoc:298"><bibl><biblScope>62.4</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>) indicate a span of at least AD 53 (under Claudius) to AD 54/55 (under Nero).</p>
<p rend="indent">Either Nero’s grant did not include all Roman public land in <placeName type="ancient">Cyrenaica</placeName>, or his grant was subsequently rescinded, for we have evidence of an operation similar to Strabo’s under the emperor Vespasian. Hyginus I, writing about types of land in the provinces, mentions inscribed boundary markers recording a Vespasianic restitution to the Roman people of land occupied by squatters (Text <ref target="ddoc:520"><bibl><biblScope>62.9</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). He indicates that these were lands that had been given to the Roman people by “king Ptolemy.” This operation is confirmed by four published boundary markers dating to all years in the span AD 71-74. These inscriptions indicate the work of the imperial legate Q. Paconius Agrippinus,  <note n="379"> During the reign of Claudius, Agrippinus<seg type="T8">(</seg>as “quaestor and boundary-setter” = <foreign xml:lang="grc">τάμιας καὶ ὁροθέτης</foreign>) had been involved in the restoration of roads and pathways on Crete: <seg type="T8">τὰς ὁδοὺς καὶ ἀνδροβάμονας ἀποκατέστησεν</seg> (five markers are known: ICret 3.3.25-29 and AE 1999.1442).

<p rend="indent">Another marker dating to sometime in the period AD 73-75 records a lease of land, in perpetuity, to one Apollonius, son of Paraebata (Text <ref target="ddoc:401"><bibl><biblScope>62.15</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). Agrippinus is nowhere in evidence. The active Roman official in this matter was the proconsul, C. Arinius Modestus, who was serving an extended second term in the province. The marker invokes Vespasian’s authority, but makes no mention of restitution, or of Ptolemy Apion. Instead, the property in question is described as “the territory of the <placeName type="ancient">Apolloniatae</placeName> which the <foreign xml:lang="la">res publica</foreign> with its allies bought.” The full implications of this designation remain obscure to me, but it would seem to mark this land as separate from the Ptolemaic properties that exercised Strabo and Agrippinus. The words <foreign xml:lang="la">divisa</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="la">locavit</foreign> are technical terms, frequently employed in the <foreign xml:lang="la">agrimensores</foreign>, that would seem to indicate a new survey and partition of the land in question.</p>
<p rend="indent">An apparently unrelated inscription dating to the eighth year of Domitian’s tribunician power (AD 88/89) records the restoration of land occupied by squatters to the <foreign xml:lang="la">civitas</foreign> of the <placeName type="ancient">Ptolemaenses</placeName> (Text <ref target="ddoc:518"><bibl><biblScope>62.16</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl></ref>). This inscription derives from the area of <placeName type="ancient">Ptolemais </placeName>(mod.
