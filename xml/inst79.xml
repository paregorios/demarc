            <note n="305" xml:id="ftn305"> In addition to enumerating the relevant entries in IGLS, Burton 2000 cites Matthews 1984, 162 for additional information. Unfortunately, Matthews’ brief overview is inadequate: it does not describe the particulars of the monument and erroneously asserts that the documents from <placeName type="modern">Khirbet el-Bilaas</placeName>are “three inscriptions on a single column” (an error of fact reiterated at Burton 2000, 210 no. 51). Burton would have done better to pass over Matthews and to cite the <seg type="term">editio princeps</seg>(Schlumberger 1939), in which much essential information omitted even from IGLS is clearly and responsibly presented. </note>

He is said to have “restored the boundaries.” Thus we should infer that he gave instructions to his delegates to mark the boundaries in accordance with an earlier judgement or specific evidence that demonstrated the status quo ante, perhaps the same original demarcation cited by the later evidence: a demarcation made by the governor of Syria ca. AD 13-17.</seg>

Either Hadrian’s verdict was abrogated by yet another flare-up of the dispute, or it was never implemented following his death. In either case, the matter came to Antoninus’ attention somehow and was addressed yet again through the governor of Syria in AD 153.</seg>
