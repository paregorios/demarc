   <p>Date(s): <date>Flavian(?) era demarcation, replaced under Hadrian</date>
   </p>
   <p>
      <seg type="instance-description">A single boundary marker, recovered in 1941 in a place called <placeName type="modern">Ou-Medas</placeName> (between <placeName type="ancient">Thagaste</placeName>, mod. <placeName type="modern">Souk-Ahras</placeName>, and <placeName type="modern">Henchir Moussa</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Algeria</placeName>), attests to an <hi rend="bold">authoritative demarcation</hi> between two tribal units, the <placeName type="ancient">Vofricenses</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Suppenses</placeName>. The boundary markers between the two parties, which had earlier been placed by <persName>C. Tullius Capito Pomponianus Plotius Firmus</persName>, were repositioned by a slave surveyor of the emperor Hadrian, on the emperor’s order (<foreign xml:lang="la">iussu imp(eratoris)</foreign>).</seg>
   </p>
   <p>The <placeName type="ancient">Vofricenses </placeName>are otherwise unknown. The <placeName type="ancient">Suppenses </placeName>only appear elsewhere in two letters of Augustine, published for the first time in 1981.<note n="462" xml:id="ftn462"> Desanges 1983, 91. </note> Almost nothing is known about either party. They are assumed to have been indigenous peoples, possibly smallish clan units. The context and reasons for both the initial demarcation and the subsequent replacement of the markers are wholly unrecoverable. It is not even clear whether Pomponianus was serving as legate of <placeName type="ancient">Legio III Augusta </placeName>or as a special legate of the emperor (possibly Flavian).<note n="463" xml:id="ftn463"> See the Prosopographical Catalog. </note> This is our only case of boundary demarcation in which an imperial slave acts as a surveyor. It is made still more unusual by failing to cite the presence of any judicially competent individual at an authoritative demarcation. There is insufficient contextual information to address the import of these issues.</p>
