   <head>Restoration of Public Lands of the <placeName type="ancient">Municipium Canusinum</placeName>
   </head>
   <p>Date(s): <date>AD 76</date>

      <seg type="instance-description">A single boundary marker discovered in the area of <placeName type="ancient">Canusium</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Canosa</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Italy</placeName>) attests to the restoration of the boundaries of public lands belonging to <placeName type="ancient">Canusium</placeName>. The restoration is attributed to the emperor <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian,</persName> and is said to have been done “according to the public maps” (<foreign xml:lang="la">ex formis publicis</foreign>). Presumably, this means copies of original survey maps were requested from <placeName type="modern">Rome,</placeName> and these were then used in a survey aimed at restoring the old boundaries.<note n="401" xml:id="ftn401"> Compare the redemarcation of the centuriated territory of <placeName type="ancient">Arausio</placeName> (mod. Orange in France), in accordance with maps provided by the emperor Vespasian (Piganiol 1962). </note> This process was no doubt necessitated by a dispute, but the details are lost to us. The text provides no insight into the mechanisms whereby this process was accomplished, nor the personnel who were involved.</seg>
