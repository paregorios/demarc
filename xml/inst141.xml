      <seg type="instance-description">A fragmentary boundary marker recovered from the area of <placeName type="ancient">Corinium</placeName>(mod. <placeName type="modern">Karin</placeName> in <placeName type="modern">Croatia</placeName>) attests to the negotiated settlement of a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi>between <placeName type="ancient">Carinium</placeName> and another community, possibly <placeName type="ancient">Ansium</placeName> (mod. <placeName type="modern">Cvijina gradina</placeName>)</seg>
   </p>
   <p>Although the short text provides very little detail, it would seem that the <placeName type="ancient">Corinienses</placeName> and the <placeName type="ancient">Ansienses</placeName> had been able to work out their boundary differences, but wanted the assistance of a surveyor to accurately establish and mark the boundaries. The governor’s role seems to have been limited to providing the surveyor and giving legal sanction to the establishment of the boundary. His order to this effect provided an authoritative endorsement of the validity of the boundary, and this is probably the reason it is cited in the inscribed text. To what degree the Roman administration may have been involved in the negotiation, or whether the terms under which it was reached were somehow dictated through judicial or other administrative means, we cannot know.</p>
