      <seg type="instance-description">A fragmentary boundary marker attests to a <hi rend="bold">boundary dispute</hi> between the cities of <placeName type="ancient">Mopsouestia</placeName> and <placeName type="ancient">Aegae</placeName> in <placeName type="ancient">Cilicia</placeName>. Enough of the text survives for us to identify distinctive terminology that indicates a judicial context (<foreign xml:lang="la">in re praesenti</foreign> = in the present case) combined with boundary demarcation (<foreign xml:lang="la">fines ... terminavit</foreign> = he marked the boundaries).</seg>
   </p>
   <p>Doblhofer liberally restores the beginning of the text on the basis of other boundary markers to read: <foreign xml:lang="la">[ex auctoritate / imp(eratoris) Caesaris / Vespasiani? Aug(usti) ... </foreign>Even if he is correct, this need not mean that the emperor was directly involved.<note n="271" xml:id="ftn271"> 
         <seg type="term">Pace</seg> AE 1966.486. </note> In lines 4 and 5, Doblhofer gives us two options for the beginning of the main clause that constitutes that remainder of the text. He must provide a nominative subject for the verb <foreign xml:lang="la">terminavit</foreign> in lines 12-13, and he must accommodate the ablative phrase of which the fragmentary titulature <foreign xml:lang="la">--- ] Asprenate C[ --- ]/ano leg(ato) pro prae(atore) provinciae Ciliciae</foreign> is the end. He gives us two options: <foreign xml:lang="la">[ ... </foreign>Name<foreign xml:lang="la"> proc(urator) Aug(usti) / decernente P(ublio)? Nonio ]</foreign> 
      <foreign xml:lang="la">Asprenate</foreign> etc. and <foreign xml:lang="la">[ ... </foreign>Name <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex datus a P(ublio)? Nonio ] Asprenate </foreign>etc. <persName>Asprenas’</persName>identity is uncertain. He may be one of two known <foreign xml:lang="la">Nonii</foreign> attested under the reigns of <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Vespasian</persName> and <persName type="emperor" rend="normal">Domitian</persName>, hence the date range for this text. Depending on which ablative construction we accept for the supplement, we must see <persName>Asprenas</persName>as either taking a subsidiary role (<foreign xml:lang="la">decernente</foreign>) to whoever was named as the subject of the verb <foreign xml:lang="la">terminavit</foreign>, or as the official with primary authority over the case, who then appoints a <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> whose name is lost. I am inclined to accept the latter proposition, for there is only one other boundary marker in which <foreign xml:lang="la">decernente</foreign> is thus used.<note n="272" xml:id="ftn272"> Instance <ref target="#INST45">
            <bibl>
               <biblScope>53</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl>
         </ref>. </note> In that text the proconsul judges a dispute that seems to have been delegated to him by the emperor. The verb <foreign xml:lang="la">termino</foreign> is not used. On the other hand there are several boundary texts that employ the verb <foreign xml:lang="la">termino</foreign> in the third person singular perfect as this one does.<note n="273" xml:id="ftn273"> Instances <ref target="#INST94">

         </ref>, as well as a number of boundary markers of the bed and banks of the Tiber (e.g., EDH HD021346 = CIL 6.40867 and EDH HD021343 = CIL 6.40868). There are two other cases where the verb or verb form is supplemented and may be suspect: Instances <ref target="#INST85">

               <biblScope>98</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl>

            <bibl>
               <biblScope>82</biblScope> (<title type="short">Elliott 2004</title>)</bibl>
         </ref>. </note> In each of these cases, it is the official with final judiciary control of the case who is the subject of the sentence (one proconsul, one imperial legate and one <foreign xml:lang="la">curator alvei et riparum Tiberis et cloacarum urbis</foreign>). There is no exact parallel for a text with <foreign xml:lang="la">terminavit</foreign> in which a <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> is mentioned, but given the fact it is the <foreign xml:lang="la">iudex</foreign> who has final judicial authority in such a case, it would be natural for his name to appear in the nominative. </p>
